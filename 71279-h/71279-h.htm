<p>Of the stories in this collection, three originally appeared in
<i>The Century Magazine</i> (“Like Michael,” copyright, 1916; “The
Emperor of Elam,” copyright, 1917; “The Emerald of Tamerlane,”
copyright, 1918), two each in <i>The Bookman</i> (“Unto the
Day,” copyright, 1904; “Studio Smoke,” copyright, 1905),
in <i>Scribner’s Magazine</i> (“The Bathers,” copyright, 1903; “Henrietta
Stackpole <i>Rediviva</i>,” copyright, 1904), and in <i>The Smart
Set</i> (“Susannah and the Elder,” copyright, 1905; “The Undoing
of Mrs. Derwall,” copyright, 1906), and one each in <i>The Associated
Sunday Magazines</i> (“Martha Waring’s Elopement,” copyright,
1904), in <i>The Outlook</i> (“The Pagan,” copyright, 1905), in
<i>Short Stories</i> (“Castello Montughi,” copyright, 1908), and in
<i>The Sunset Magazine</i> (“The Bald Spot,” copyright, 1909).</p>

<p>It may be added that the names of three of these stories are
not the ones first copyrighted and that at least two of them have
been completely recast, while not one of them has been left untouched
in its earliest state. The writer nevertheless takes
this occasion to express to the editors and publishers of the above
periodicals, as well as to Mr. W. J. O’Brien and to Messrs. Small,
Maynard and Company—who made use of “The Emperor of
Elam” in <i>The Best Short Stories of 1917</i>—his thanks both for
their former hospitality and for their present courtesy in permitting
him to reassemble his work. Nor would this small
payment of indebtedness be complete without mention of Colonel
J. R. M. Taylor, who wrote the first draft of “The Emerald of
Tamerlane,” and who generously allows it to be reprinted over
the signature of his collaborator.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>What was he like?</p>

<p>H’m! That’s rather a large order. What
are people like, I wonder? Some of them are
like dogs. There are plenty of poodles and bull pups
walking around on two legs. Some of them are like
cats. Some of them are like pigs. A few of them are
like hyenas. More of them are like fishes in aquariums.
A lot of them are like horses—of all kinds,
from thoroughbreds and racers to those big, honest,
comprehending, uncomplaining creatures that drag
drays. But I have a notion that most of them are
like you and me.</p>

<p>What are we like, though? If we happen to be
like Greek gods—which we don’t!—if we have red
hair or vampire eyes or humps on our backs, if we
harpoon whales or compose operas or put poison in
our mother-in-law’s soup, it is possible to make out
for us a likely enough <i>dossier</i>. Yet how far does that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
<i>dossier</i> go? It tells less than a tintype at a county
fair. Vamp eyes or godlike legs, even the ability to
compose operas, have nothing to do with the way
we react when we inherit a billion dollars or lose our
last cent, when our wives get on our nerves or the
boiler of our ship blows up at sea. And what on
earth are you to say about people like Michael, who
are neither tall nor short, fat nor thin, good nor bad?
Or people whose wives never get on their nerves and
whose boilers never blow up? They have their
<i>dossier</i> all the same. Why not? They do nine-tenths
of the work of the world. They lay its stones
one upon another. They commit their share of its
follies, suffer their share of its sorrows, and pay
more than their share of the bill.</p>

<p>What was Michael like? My good man, you loll
there with your ungodlike leg over the arm of your
chair and you blandly propose to me the ultimate
problem of art! One would think you were Flaubert—or
was he Guy de Maupassant?—who made it out
possible to tell, in words that have neither line nor
colour, that are gone as soon as you have spoken
them, how one grocer sitting in his door differs from
all other grocers sitting in doors. I have spent hours,
I have lost nights, over that wretched grocer; and
I haven’t learned any more about him than when I
began: except to suspect that Maupassant—or was
it Theophile Gautier?—wanted to be Besnard and
Rodin too. I grant you that no grocer looks precisely
like another. But that isn’t Maupassant’s business—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
tell how a grocer looks. The thing simply can’t
be done. Nor is it enough for your grocer to sit in
his door. He must say something, he must do something,
or words won’t catch him. And then how do
you know why he said or did that particular thing,
or what he would say or do at another time?</p>

<p>And you have the courage to ask me, between two
whiffs of a cigarette, what Michael was like! How
the deuce do I know? I never had anything particular
to do with him. He was like fifty million other
people with lightish hair and darkish eyes and youngish
tastes, whom neither their neighbours nor their
inner devil have beaten into distinction. If I tried
to tell you what a man like that is like, I would land
you in more volumes than “Jean Christophe.” I can
only tell you what he was like at two very different
moments of his life, in two entirely different places.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are naturalist enough to construct
the rest of him out of that. I, for one, am not. But
it’s astounding how little we know about people,
really, and how childishly we expect miracles of
each newcomer. It isn’t as if anybody ever did
anything new. How can they? Nobody is radically
different from anybody else. The only thing is that
some of us are a little harder or a little softer, some
of us are longer-winded or shorter-winded, some of
us see better out of our eyes or have less idea what
to do with our hands. That isn’t all, though. There
are other things, outside of us, for which we are
neither to blame nor to praise—the houses we happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to be born in, the winds that blow us, arrows
that fly by day and terrors that walk by night. And
then there are other people. They come, they go,
they get ideas into their heads, they put ideas into
ours. It may be pure bull luck whether you are a
grocer sitting in your door for a Maupassant to
scratch his head over, or something more—definite,
shall we say?</p>

<p>Michael, now: why should a man like that disappear?
Would you disappear? Would I disappear?
Why on earth should Michael have disappeared?
Surely not for the few thousand dollars
that disappeared at the same time. Nothing was
the matter with him. He had a good enough job.
He was married to a nice enough girl. He would
have prospered and grown fat and begotten a little
Michael or two to follow in his footsteps. But those
reaping and binding people take it into their heads
to send him over there, and he suddenly vanishes
like a collar-button in a crack. And we all make a
terrific hullabaloo about it—when the thing to make
a hullabaloo about is that one man may get all
geography to reap and bind in, while another may
never get outside his valley.</p>

<p>The thing in itself was infinitely simpler than one
of Michael’s confounded reapers and binders.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I suppose you know Aurora—Mrs. Michael as
was? I began stepping on her toes at dances twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
years ago, and I believe I could tell you what she is
like. This country is a factory of Auroras. Dozens
of her pass under that window every day, all turned
out to sample as if by machinery, all run by the same
interior clockwork, all well made, well dressed, well
educated—in the American sense; also well able to
milk a cow or to carry one on their backs, but preferring
to harangue clubs all day, to dance all night, in
any case to circumvent the ingenuity of life in playing
us nasty tricks. They won’t do anything they
don’t like, and they shut their eyes to the dark o’
the moon.</p>

<p>Just what Aurora wanted of Michael, I can’t say.
As the poet hath it, there is a tide in the affairs of
women which, taken at the flood, leads God knows
where. But these things are not so awfully mysterious.
There was a period in Aurora’s history when,
it being reported to her that the simple Michael had
likened her eyes to Japanese lanterns, she was not
displeased. And I have been told on the best authority
that even a suffragette may not be averse to
having her hand held. Whether Michael first
grabbed Aurora’s or whether Aurora first grabbed
Michael’s doesn’t much matter. There came a later
period when they were both able to recall that historic
event with considerable detachment.</p>

<p>Aurora likewise lived to learn that there are other
ways of circumventing the tricks of life than by
reaping and binding. She thirsted for higher things,
for wider horizons, than those of Zerbetta, Ohio.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Above all human trophies she burned for two which
cohabit not too readily under one roof—Culture and
Romance. So when Michael was unexpectedly ordered
to the East she accompanied him only as far
as Paris.</p>

<p>My relations with her, I regret to say, were such
that she did not confide to me what she thought when
Michael failed to turn up again. You can easily
perceive, however, that Michael translated, Michael
probably murdered, Michael made, at all events,
for once in his life, mysterious, was a very different
pair of sleeves from the Michael she had not considered
important enough to see off on his Orient
Express. Aurora was never the one to miss that.
It put her in the papers. It made her a heroine. It
invested her with the romance for which she yearned.
It also invested her with extremely becoming mourning.
Yet I fancied once or twice that I detected in
her a shade of annoyance. She was capable of choosing
an occultist for her second husband, but in the
bottom of her heart she hated people to be as indefinite
as Michael. She naturally did not like, either,
a rumour of which she had caught echoes, that
Michael had run away from her.</p>

<p>Well, when Aurora heard that I was going to
Constantinople, she asked me to find out what I
could. It was quite a bit afterward, you know, and
she had already entered the holy bonds of wedlock
with her occultist. But she couldn’t quite get over
that exasperating indefiniteness of Michael’s. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
wanted to put a tangible tombstone over him—with
a quatrain of her own composition, and the occultist’s
symbol of the macrocosm. Wayne, too—Michael’s
uncle, and one of the reaping and binding
partners—suggested that I quietly look about once
more. What the partners principally minded, of
course, was their money. Yet it wasn’t such a huge
sum, and Michael really did them a good turn after
all, the ironic dog. They could well afford the fat
reward they offered. They got no end of free advertising,
you know, what with the fuss the State Department
made, and all. People who had sat in
darkness all their lives, never having heard of a
reaper and binder, suddenly saw a great light when
the Bosphorus was dragged and Thrace and Asia
Minor sifted for an obscure agent of reapers and
binders.</p>

<p>Such are the advantages of getting yourself robbed
and murdered, as compared to those of working your
head off to keep your job. Michael, to be sure—I
ended by finding out all about Michael, long after
I had given him up. It was nothing but an accident.
I wonder, though, that we go on believing there’s
anything in this world except accident. And the
beauty of this accident is that I can’t claim
that reward I need so much—one of the beauties.
It was altogether, for Aurora and Michael even
more than for me, such a characteristic case of
missing what you look for and finding what you
don’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>I never told Wayne. I never told Aurora. I
never intended to tell you. Another accident! But
isn’t it aggravating how one’s best stories always
have to be kept dark?</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>So the romantic Aurora, as I told you, sat in Paris
like a true American wife, inviting her soul in the
Louvre—both <i>musée</i> and <i>magasins</i>—while the humdrum
Michael set forth for that bourne whence he
was not to return, with his reaper and binder under
his arm. What he did with it doesn’t matter. In
fact I believe he did very little with it. He wasn’t
born to reaping and binding. Reaping and binding
had been thrust upon him—by the uncle to whom
he applied at a desperate moment for a job. Like
most of us, you see, he didn’t know what he wanted.
I’m not sure he ever found out. Aurora, however,
must have helped him in a back-handed way to find
out that he hadn’t got what he wanted. And so did
that sudden journey of his. He had never been
anywhere before in his life.</p>

<p>I make fun of poor Aurora, who after all had perhaps
divined in poor Michael, at the flood of her
tide, what she was really after. But I found it
rather quaint, I must confess, that he, the reaper and
binder of Zerbetta, Ohio, should be caught by Stambul.
Yet why not? I myself am unaccountably
moved by reapers and binders, by motors and dynamos
and steam engines, by all manner of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
ingenuities of which I know nothing and could never
learn anything. Why should not Michael have been
moved by things as foreign to him? Moreover has
there not always been in the Anglo-Saxon some uneasy
little chord that has made him the wanderer
and camper-out of the earth, that nothing can twitch
like the East?</p>

<p>Michael took an astonishing fancy to that bumpy
old place, and to those mangy dogs and those fantastic
smells and those inconvenient costumes and those
dusty Bazaars and all the trash that is in them. He
bought quantities of it. Rugs and brasses and I
don’t know what uncannily kept turning up long
after he had dropped through his crack. Aurora
received them tearfully as tributes to herself, and I
believe they paved the way for her next experiment.
Michael’s successor is an antiquary as well as an
astrologer, and he keeps an occult junk-shop on a
top floor in Union Square.</p>

<p>That junk, as it happened, was just what played
so fateful a part in Michael’s adventure. He bought
a good deal of it from a certain antiquity man who
knew English better than any one else Michael ran
across in the Bazaars. Finding Michael a promising
customer, the antiquity man said he had better stuff
stored away in a <i>khan</i> outside the Bazaars. And
Michael, of course, was delighted to go and look at
it. Do you wonder?</p>

<p>The <i>khan</i> was one of those old stone houses in
Mahmud Pasha that have a Byzantine look about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
them, with their string-courses of flat bricks, the
heavy stone brackets of their projecting upper storeys,
the solid iron cages of their windows, and their
arched tunnels leading into courts within courts,
where grape-vines grow and rugs lie fading in the
sun. The antiquity man took Michael up some
stone stairs into one of the galleries overlooking a
court, and then into a series of dirty little stone
rooms full of all sorts of queer-looking boxes and
bundles. And some of the boxes and bundles were
opened with great ceremony, and Rhodian plates
were brought forth for Michael to admire—Persian
tiles, Byzantine enamels—You know the sort of
thing.</p>

<p>Michael, our reaper and binder, liked it. I can’t
say how intelligently he liked it; but he had discovered
a new world, and he liked it well enough to
go back again and again. I must confess that I
don’t recollect very much about it, myself. I do
remember, though, that the most outlandish-looking
people—Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Persians, Tartars,
Heaven knows who—carry on outlandish-looking
activities there. Any number of forges and
blow-pipes flare in those dark stone rooms, where
goldsmiths and silversmiths make charms, amulets,
reliquaries, little Virgins to hang around your neck,
little votive hands and feet to hang on icons, silver
rings for Turks who think it wicked to wear gold,
and filigree chains, pendants, and lamps in the
Byzantine tradition. That’s where most of the antiques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
sold in the Bazaars come from. And devilishly
well-made a lot of them are, too. I know a Byzantine
gold chalice in a museum in England, decorated
with St. Georges of the tenth century, that
came out of that <i>khan</i> not twenty years ago! Admirable
coins and gems come from there too, to say
nothing of Tanagra figurines. Did you ever hear of
a Chalcedonian figurine? Not many other people
have, either. But plenty of real ones used to be dug
up on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; and clever
Greek potters copy them and rename them for tourists.
However, it isn’t all fake. There are real artists
in those dark little stone rooms. And there are
real antiques—some of them stored away, some of
them undergoing a final dilapidation to suit them for
the critical eye of fake collectors.</p>

<p>Michael liked it all so much that he spent more
time in that extraordinary maze than was good for
his reapers and binders. The people got to know
him by sight, and they let him rummage around by
himself.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He turned up one afternoon to look at some pottery,
and the antiquity man happened to be out.
Michael was therefore given coffee and left more or
less to his own devices. Nobody could talk to him,
you see, and the antiquity man was coming back.</p>

<p>Michael prowled mildly about, finding nothing
much to look at but packing-cases and kerosene tins—those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
big rectangular ones that everybody in the
Levant hoards like gold. He presently recognised,
however, on top of a pile of boxes, a basket that he
had seen at the antiquity man’s shop in the Bazaars—a
basket, with an odd little red figure in the wicker,
containing embroideries. He managed to get it
down, and found it unexpectedly heavy. It turned
out to be full this time of broken tiles. He poked
them over. Each bit was worth something—for a
flower on it, or an Arabic letter, or a glint of Persian
lustre. But as he poked down through them, what
should he come across but some funny-looking metal
things: some round, some square, some with clockwork
fastened to them. It suddenly occurred to him
to wonder if bombs looked like that! He proceeded,
very gingerly, to replace the bits of tile.</p>

<p>Just then he became aware that the antiquity man
had come in quietly and was looking at him.</p>

<p>“What the devil have you got here?” asked
Michael, with a laugh. “An ammunition factory?”</p>

<p>The antiquity man shrugged his shoulders and
smiled.</p>

<p>“I have better than that. I have a Rhages jar
for you to look at, if you will come this way.”</p>

<p>A Rhages jar! I don’t suppose Michael had ever
until that moment heard of a Rhages jar. However,
he followed the antiquity man into another room
even more crowded with boxes and tins; and there,
to be sure, the Rhages jar was put into his hands.
But the place was so dark he could hardly see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“If you will excuse me another moment,” said the
antiquity man, “I will get a light.”</p>

<p>He was gone, as he said, only a moment. When he
came back a servant followed him, carrying a candle—a
big porter whom Michael already knew by sight,
in baggy blue clothes and a red girdle. Michael
nodded to him, and the man salaamed. Then the
antiquity man pointed out to Michael, by the light
of the candle, the beauties of the Rhages jar. As he
did so another man came in, an older man with a
grizzled beard. He gravely saluted Michael and
took the candle from the porter, who went out. The
porter very soon returned, however. This time he
carried a tray on which was one of those handleless
little cups of Turkish coffee in a holder of filigree
silver. The antiquity man set down the Rhages jar.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have a cup of coffee?” he said, making
a sign to the porter.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” replied Michael. That was one
thing about Stambul he didn’t altogether like—that
eternal sipping of muddy coffee.</p>

<p>“Oh, but just one!” insisted the antiquity man.
“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had one already,” answered Michael. “I’m
not used to it, you know. It keeps me awake.”</p>

<p>The antiquity man smiled a little.</p>

<p>“But not this coffee,” he said. “I think you will
find that it does not keep you awake.”</p>

<p>It began to come over Michael that there was
more than the coffee which he didn’t like. Was it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the air in that stuffy dark little stone room? Was it
the way in which the three men looked at him? Was
it that basket of broken tiles?</p>

<p>“No thanks,” he said. And he added: “Let’s go
out where we can see. It’s too hot in here, too.”</p>

<p>He looked around for the door. He couldn’t see
it from where he stood. The antiquity man said
something, and the porter stood aside. Michael
stepped past him, around some big boxes. The door
was there. Michael suddenly heard it click; but in
front of it a fourth man stood in the shadow. He did
not move when Michael stepped forward. He stood
there in front of the door, with his hands in his coat
pockets. Michael was quite sure he didn’t like that.</p>

<p>“<i>Pardon</i>,” he said, “I want to go out.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head. At a word from the antiquity
man, however, he moved aside, keeping his
hands in his pockets. Michael reached out for the
door. It was locked.</p>

<p>He liked that least of all. He had a sudden impulse
to pound the door, the man beside him. Yet
the next moment he was ashamed of it. He turned
around. The others had come forward, around the
boxes—the antiquity man, the big porter with the
tray, the old man carrying the candle. In the light
of it Michael looked at the other one, the one who
had shut the door. He was young and very dark,
with a scar across his chin. Michael looked at them
all. What in the world had come over them? Could
it be that they took that basket of tiles too seriously?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Could it be that they, too, were not what they
seemed, that under their first friendliness were black
and uncanny things? All the old wives’ tales that
Westerners hear of the East came vaguely, yet disquietingly,
back to him. It was with an effort that
he folded his arms and turned to the antiquity man.</p>

<p>“Your methods of doing business,” he remarked,
“strike me as being rather peculiar.”</p>

<p>“It is a peculiar business,” said the antiquity
man.</p>

<p>“Is it your idea that people should be forced to
buy Rhages jars whether they want them or not?”</p>

<p>“The Rhages jar is not for sale,” replied the antiquity
man.</p>

<p>“O!” exclaimed Michael. “Then what is the
matter? What are you after?”</p>

<p>“Not your money,” said the antiquity man.
“Please believe that, sir. And please believe that
we are very sorry. It is—what shall I say?—what
we call here <i>kismet</i>, fate. If you had not chanced to
notice that basket, if you had not taken it down and
examined it, nothing would have happened.”</p>

<p>“What have I to do with that?” burst out Michael.
“Is it my fault if you put baskets where people can
see them and then go away? Am I responsible for
your carelessness?”</p>

<p>“Your question, sir, is unfortunately most just.
But that is a part of the <i>kismet</i>—that having been
careless ourselves, we are obliged to make you pay
for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Well, how am I going to pay?” demanded
Michael. “Spend the rest of my life in here?”</p>

<p>The antiquity man hesitated before answering.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said at last, softly. And he added:
“Will you have your coffee now?”</p>

<p>Michael could hardly take it in. What did the fellow
mean? Then something in the way the antiquity
man looked at him made him remember about the
coffee—that it would not keep him awake. For the
life of him he could not help glancing down at it.
How was it that he didn’t happen to drink it when
they first brought it in? And if he had—He stared
at the stuff in its pretty silver holder. Behind it
something bright caught a flicker from the candle—a
knife in the porter’s girdle. Why not? They all
carried them. Yet his eye travelled to the pocket of
the dark young man by the door. All of a sudden
Michael knew as well as if he saw it that there was
a revolver in that pocket, and that the young man
had his finger on the trigger. Michael’s eyes travelled
on, up to the eyes of the young man, to the eyes of
them all. What strange, glistening, dark eyes they
all had, too dark to see into! He found all of a sudden
that he felt a little cold. He was even afraid for
a moment that he was going to tremble....</p>

<p>What really preoccupied him, though, was how
the thing had happened. How could such a thing
happen so suddenly? It had all been perfectly simple
and natural—his work for his firm, his journey
abroad, his coming to Constantinople, his prowling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in the Bazaars, his happening to buy a gimcrack of
the antiquity man, his introduction to this queer old
place, his pawing over those broken tiles. It was all
so simple. It would, at any step, have been so easy to
avoid. And it was so unjust, it was so fantastically
unjust. How could things end as incredibly as that?
How could he let them end like that? He was one,
and they were four; and they were armed, and he was
not. But he wouldn’t take it sitting down. The
Anglo-Saxon in him stiffened his back and set his
teeth. He began looking around stealthily, at the
bare stone walls, at the littered floor, for something
to get hold of. He would show them yet....</p>

<p>“You must not think,” said the antiquity man,
“that we have no sympathy for your position. But
do not think, either, that any—any display of the
emotions will help you. No one can possibly hear.”</p>

<p>That was the moment when Michael found it
hardest to keep his head. If he had been a little
younger he probably would not have kept his head.
“Display of the emotions”! But he realised at last
that for some incomprehensible reason they meant
business. He hoped his emotions did not display
themselves in his voice.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said. “I see you aren’t pick-pockets,
and I see that by accident I have discovered
something you do not wish known. Well, if you had
kept quiet I might never have thought of that basket
again. Or I might now try to buy your Rhages jar—for
any figure you might name. As it is, I give you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
my word of honour that never so long as I live will I
breathe a word to any human being. You know me.
Don’t you believe what I say? But if you don’t I
will sign my name to any document you care to draw
up. If you ever hear of my breaking my word, I am
willing to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>At this the old man spoke for the first time.
Michael could not understand what he said. He did
not even recognise the language in which the old
man spoke. He had a curiously deep voice. The
antiquity man answered incomprehensibly. Then
he turned back to Michael:</p>

<p>“I do believe what you say. I do not question
your word of honour. But, unfortunately, we cannot
take any chances—even the most remote. And impressions,
you know, even the strongest of them,
like love and grief, have a way of losing their force.
Suppose we let you go. There might come very
naturally a time when your recollections of this incident
would lose their intensity, or when you would
regard your promise as less important than you do
now. Why not? Life is like that. Life would be
intolerable if it were not like that. Things happen,
and then other things happen. I have not the honour
of any great acquaintance with you, but it is conceivable
that you might sometime be offered wine
which you could not refuse, or that a beautiful
woman might make an impression on you, or that a
company of distinguished men might be relating interesting
experiences; and before you knew it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
story of this afternoon would slip from you. Or you
might dream aloud. You might have a fever. These
possibilities, I admit, are very remote, or the probability
of any harm resulting to us. Still, you never
can tell. Stories have a strange way of travelling.
Sometimes they travel from New York to Constantinople.
We have known cases. For that reason we—have
prepared that cup of coffee. We must secure
ourselves against one chance in a thousand.”</p>

<p>Michael saw it. He was like that. He had that
fatal little flaw of the artist, of being able to see the
other side. He saw it then as distinctly as he saw
the four dark faces, the candle burning quietly in the
dark little room, the dark shapes and shadows of the
boxes. He wondered what dark strange thing was
hidden here—that meant so much to these men. He
wondered about the men themselves, whom he had
taken so casually.</p>

<p>“Your life, of course,” the antiquity man went on,
“is very precious to you. That we perfectly understand.
While life is seldom satisfactory, it contains,
after all, a great deal for one still as young as you.
And one always hopes—often with reason. We ask
you to believe that we understand that. We also ask
you to believe that no one of us has any personal
reason for wishing you harm. We excessively regret
the necessity of asking you to drink that cup of coffee.
We shall continue all our lives to regret it. Nevertheless,
you can perhaps understand that there may
be reasons why even your life is of less moment to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
than the possibility of your some day forgetting for
an instant the promise you now so sincerely make.”</p>

<p>Michael still saw it. He saw, too, what had been
growing steadily clearer, that this was an antiquity
man among antiquity men. But what he saw best
of all, through that portentous candle-light, was a
sudden mirage of the summer sun—out of which
he had stepped so lightly. He saw it so vividly that
his voice had in it a thickness he didn’t like:</p>

<p>“I understand. But there are chances and
chances. For instance, can a man disappear like
that, even in Constantinople, and no questions be
asked? When I fail to go back to my hotel, to pay
my bill, will they say nothing? When I fail to go
back to my country will my friends say nothing? Of
course not! There will be a row. It may not be to-morrow,
it may not be the next day. I do not pretend
to be a person of importance. But sooner or
later questions will be asked. And sooner or later
you will have to answer some of them. What will
you say then?”</p>

<p>“We have thought of that,” answered the antiquity
man. “We can see that if it is dangerous to
let you go from here, it is also dangerous to let others
come to look for you here. But by the time they
come, they will at least find no baskets of broken
tiles.” He gave Michael a moment in which to take
it in. “If the matter be at last traced to us, it will
be a simple one of robbery and murder. For that
reason we shall have to keep whatever valuables you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
may have. We are very sorry that we shall not be
able to send them back to your family.”</p>

<p>“My money belongs to my firm, not to my family,”
protested Michael. “If you keep it, you will
take not only my life, but my honour. It certainly
will not be to your interest to prevent them from
thinking that I have stolen it and run away.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied the antiquity man. “But
I do not need to tell you that human actions are usually
misunderstood. Even you, perhaps, do not understand
that our own motive is not an interested
one. There is only One who understands. I may
point out to you, however, that we run the risk of
suffering from a similar imputation. It will probably
be thought that we have killed you for your
money. And you must realise that in that case I,
perhaps all of us, stand an excellent chance of following
you—wherever you go. But that chance we take
more willingly than the other.”</p>

<p>He said it simply, without gestures, without airs.
Michael could not help seeing it and rising to it. He
even could not help liking the antiquity man. Evidently
it was not a common affair in which he had
happened to tangle himself....</p>

<p>He saw it, but somehow he felt his sense of reality
slipping. He had often wondered, vaguely enough,
as one does when the sun is warm about one and the
end of life is very far off and incredible, what the end
of life would be like—how it could come, whether he
would make a fool of himself. But of all the possibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
he had imagined, he had never imagined this
little stone room in Stambul, and this candle, and
these shadows, and these four inscrutable dark faces
of men whom he did not know. Was he making a
fool of himself now to say, as he did, thickly:</p>

<p>“Give me your cup of coffee.” He tried to clear
his throat. “But you might at least tell me first
what all this fuss is about. Or are you afraid I shall
tell them in the next world?”</p>

<p>He saw a light in the antiquity man’s eye. The
old man saw it, too. There ensued a conversation
between them, in which the young man, his hand
still in his pocket, joined. The porter stood statuesque,
with his tray of poisoned coffee. Michael, left
to himself, began to feel his sense of reality come
back.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “my coffee is getting
cold.”</p>

<p>The antiquity man smiled.</p>

<p>“My friend here”—he pointed to the old man—“has
made a suggestion. He seems to have taken a
fancy to you. In fact I may assure you that we are all
pleased at the way you have received the very
disagreeable things we have unfortunately had to
say to you. Some men, in the circumstances,
would have been abject. You might have begged,
bribed, wept, fainted, what do I know? We have
seen—And we feel sure, as we did not at first,
that you did not come here on purpose to find—that
basket of tiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>He narrowed his eyes a little as he looked at
Michael, making another of his eloquent pauses.
Michael didn’t like it, but he couldn’t help asking:</p>

<p>“Well, what is your suggestion?”</p>

<p>“Are you willing,” asked the antiquity man, slowly,
“to change your religion?”</p>

<p>“Change my religion?” echoed Michael, uncomprehendingly.
“I’m afraid I haven’t much religion
to change.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” returned the antiquity man.
“So it is with most people of intelligence. If, however,
you were willing to change your religion, if you
were also willing to change your language, your name,
your home, your wife even, for others as different
from them as can be conceived, if you could bring
yourself to make that sacrifice and to become one of
us, it would not be necessary for you to drink that
cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>Michael saw it. He caught his breath. But—</p>

<p>“I must ask you to decide quickly,” continued
the antiquity man. “We all have affairs. And if it
should become necessary for us to answer those
questions of which you spoke, it would be better for
witnesses to be able to say that we were not in here
too long this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Michael saw that, too. And all the blood in him
quickened at the chance of life. Life! His life had
not been such a success. Why not wipe the slate
clean and start over again? It ironically came to
him that Aurora would call that romance—to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
cornered here like a rat in a trap while four men he
didn’t know stared at him with a candle! But why,
on the other hand, should he give in to them? That
was cowardice, even if it was irony, too—to die for
what he didn’t want and didn’t believe in....
The immensity of the dilemma was too much for him.
Irresistible force, immovable obstacle—that flashed
inconsequently into his head. Was the light going
out? The room grew darker. He tried again to
clear his throat. It suddenly came to him that he
didn’t even know who these people were, and what
they wanted him to become....</p>

<p>The antiquity man reached forward, lifted the
coffee-cup out of its silver holder, and dropped it on
the stone floor. Michael stared down stupidly at
the bits of broken porcelain. They were like the bits
of broken tiles. He wondered if his trousers were
spattered....</p>

<p>The young man took his hand out of his pocket
and opened the door.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>How do I know? I don’t. I only know what
Michael told me. Which wasn’t much. He was like
that, you see! Then he was too mortally afraid of
its getting back here. He wouldn’t open up as little
as he did till he heard Aurora had married again!
And here you ask who and when and where and why.
O Lord! If you would only let a man tell his story
and stop when he is through!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>However, even you must know that Constantinople
enjoys quite a reputation for liveliness, of sorts,
and that it was particularly lively just before and just
after the German War. It was then that I got out
there, as a courier—while the armistice was on. Although
it was a good bit after the episode of the coffee
cup, I saw quite a number of people who remembered
Michael. Of course a good many other people and
things had disappeared since his day—including, I
suppose, the antiquity man and his bombs. A few
Turks or Tartars might have told me something
about that, if they lived to tell tales. But of course
I had yet to hear about the antiquity man—the interesting
part of him, I mean. And witnesses had
seen Michael drive away from the <i>khan</i> in a closed
carriage.</p>

<p>What no witness had seen was the number of the
carriage, or the door it drove to. And they told me
another yarn about a carriage driving full tilt at dusk
into the open draw of the Bridge. I asked myself if
poor old Michael were still sitting in it. That version,
at any rate, is the one now accepted by Aurora.
She has given up her tombstone and her quatrain.
She perceives that it isn’t every lady who can boast
one husband at home among the stars and another
sitting in a brougham at the bottom of the Golden
Horn.</p>

<p>So I gave Michael up. Perhaps I did it the more
easily because there were so many other things to
think about: couriering, relieving, reporting—any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
number of odd jobs connected with all that mess
out there. They took me hither and yon about the
Balkans and the Black Sea, on errands that might
have sounded quite fantastic before the war plunged
thousands of unsuspecting people into adventures a
hundred times more so. And one day I landed in
Batum.</p>

<p>Everybody who lives in Batum swears it’s the
dreariest hole on the face of the earth. An English
officer I met even sighed piteously to me over the
lost delights of Aden! However, I found Batum
very amusing, with its higglety-pigglety air of somebody
having stirred up a piece of Turkey with a
piece of Russia and having turned the mixture out
to cool in a corner of the Riviera. To be sure, there
are rather too many Georgians and Lazzes and other
queer customers prowling around; and the Hôtel
de France does too little to live up to its name. Also,
that cooling process will evidently take time. But
the setting of cloudy white peaks and a misnamed
sea is quite worthy of the Riviera. And I must insist
that the Boulevard is a really perfect little park.
You should see how close the palms and the cypresses
march to the white shingle.</p>

<p>Well, I was warming a tin chair in that park one
afternoon, watching the operatic crowd, admiring
the great wild hills of their Caucasus through their
mannered cypresses, listening to the incantation of
their Black Sea through their Glinka, and thinking
of nothing in particular, when I suddenly made two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
discoveries. One was that that Coon song we used
to sing about “Lou, Lou, I love you” came out of
<i>Life for the Czar</i>. The other was that Michael, our
vanished reaper and binder, far from having disappeared
in the Golden Horn with Aurora’s phantom
coupé or from having otherwise evaporated, sat solid
and sunburned in another tin chair of the Boulevard,
eyeing me. To be sure he was moustached, uniformed,
medalled, booted, disguised as a kind of
bastard Cossack with all manner of strange accoutrements
and insignia. But it was Michael. What
is more he presently grinned, albeit a trifle sheepishly,
pulling up his tin chair beside mine.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you were going to be melodramatic,”
he said. “As it is, let’s have a chat.”</p>

<p>We had a chat. Tin chairs in parks always remind
me of that chat. At the time I thought it the
most interesting chat I ever had. That was before
I proposed to Alice.</p>

<p>“I suppose they think I took the money, eh?”
Michael finally asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. “They think you took the
money.”</p>

<p>“H’m. I’ve made it up to them without their knowing.
So that’s all right. And—what about Aurora?”</p>

<p>I told him about Aurora. He was longer with his
“H’m” that time. Do you know? I believe the fellow
was human enough to be jealous of an astrologer
whom he didn’t envy! However, he ended by letting
out another:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“So that’s all right.”</p>

<p>“And you?” I ventured.</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything at first. He sat there
fingering his gewgaws and staring at the sea.</p>

<p>“How’s a man to know whether he’s all right or
all wrong?” he finally demanded.</p>

<p>“Hell!” objected I. “It isn’t your fault if you
happen to be sitting in Batum instead of in Zerbetta—or
at the bottom of the Golden Horn. You couldn’t
have invented such an end for yourself if you had
tried till you were black in the face. That antiquity
gang is responsible, not you. But I bet—”</p>

<p>But I concluded not to. As for Michael, he continued
to study the afternoon blue of the sea. Down
the edge of it a steamer trailed a long dark line of
smoke toward the West.</p>

<p>“I suppose I could go back home if I really wanted
to,” he said, “now that my antiquity man has pulled
off his republic. Yet after all, what good would it
do? You can see for yourself—The worst of it,
though, is that I don’t really want to. You get interested
in people, you know, in spite of yourself—even
when they have Jew noses and jabber Armenian.
I’d like to see their show through. Then they’ve
been no end decent to me. I’ve a vine and fig tree
of my own—up Ararat way! I have a house to live
in, and a horse to ride, and a wife to beat. I do it,
too. I’ve learned that much,” he pronounced darkly,
in a tone that struck me at first as irrelevant.
On consideration, however, I decided it wasn’t.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
“Anyhow,” he went on, “I’m alive; and I can’t say
I’m sorry. The funny thing about it is that I never
knew it till I came so near stepping off. I’ve had
some pretty narrow squeaks since then, too. And
my chances of dropping in my boots are still a lot
brighter than yours. All the same, it’s better than
peddling those damned hay-rakes. But once in a
while,” the inconsequent devil blurted out, “I come
down here and listen to the band.”</p>

<p>Now can you imagine a man being like that? But
if you ever breathe a word to a living soul—!</p>

</div>


<p>Thanks to Henry James—on whom be peace—I
am a man without a trade. One by one he
used to appropriate my most precious models
until I came to await each new book with a curiosity
which no disinterested reader could imagine. A surprising
number of his so-called creations—how little
did he create them only he and I could tell!—I knew
long before knowing him. Roderick Hudson, for
instance, I met at a villa in the Euganean Hills, and
regarded as my peculiar prey, in days before the
precipice. And, indeed, he has not gone over it yet;
but it is only a question of time. The Princess Casamassima,
too, is an old friend of mine who oscillates
between Paris and Constantinople. She is shortly
to be married, I hear, and that is a turn unkinder
than any Mr. James has done me. Then there is
Osmond. Often as I have seen him, though, he would
probably tell you that he dared say but didn’t really
recollect. They will never admit that they are
fathomable, those people. As for Madame Merle,
I believe I have met her once only. Christopher
Newman, however, and the Baroness Münster, and
Gordon Wright, and poor little Maisie—But I might
go on indefinitely, picking out persons of my acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
whom Mr. James in some unaccountable
way discovered first.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of this purely accidental disadvantage
under which I suffer, it must be said that the printed
fortunes of these friends of mine afford me, in many
cases, a pleasure superior to that of actual intercourse.
I have to confess, too, that Mr. James has
not seldom lent me the key to mysteries of character
which would have remained inscrutable but for his
elucidation. It has even happened, furthermore, that
an introduction from him has been so complete that
when later I came to meet the person in real life it
was like being at a play which one has seen before.
I knew in advance exactly what to expect.</p>

<p>A cognate case was my encounter with Henrietta
Stackpole, the spirited journalist in “The Portrait
of a Lady.” As I did not recognise her at first sight,
it is quite possible that the reader may fail to do so.
Indeed, some to whom I tell the story roundly declare
they do not believe a word of it. I can only insist
that it happened years and years ago, at a far
less sophisticated period of our history; that the
name on the card was unmistakable; and that Henrietta
was a caprice, if you will, but a perfectly credible
one, of a rapid and uneven civilisation.</p>

<p>My second introduction to her came about in this
wise. I was staying at the time in Venice—a city
in which it has been my good fortune to spend much
of my life and in which I would count it perfect happiness
to spend the whole. A prevalence of rainy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
<i>scirocco</i> had for two or three days diminished the
enchantments of the summer lagoon. It was therefore
natural, on the morning in question, that I
should have gone unconsciously to that place which is
always aglow when the world is grey, which is always
warm when the wind is cold, which is always
cool when the sun is hot—the miraculous church of
St. Mark’s. There I established myself at the base
of my favourite pier and proceeded to the familiar
enjoyment of sensations which this is not the place
to describe.</p>

<p>Presently there crossed my line of vision a lady.
This was not in itself a phenomenon so extraordinary.
St. Mark’s, like other churches, usually contains
more women than men; in the course of a year I
doubt not that more Americans enter it than Italians;
and of American travellers, young women—to use
the phrase in its most generous sense—vastly outnumber
persons of other descriptions. Indeed, it is
a tradition implanted in the European mind only
more ineradicably by the doughboys of 1918 that
ours is a land of Amazons, whence the few indispensable
males are seldom allowed to escape. There
crossed my line of vision, then, a damsel of my own
nationality. A certain peculiarity attached to her
from the fact that she carried no Baedeker. Nor
did she appear to have ties with any person or group
of persons provided with a copy of that useful work.
What particularly attracted my attention to her,
however, was a large silver ornament which she bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
on a <i>revers</i> of her tailor-made costume. It represented—so
far as I could make out—a human head and
bust, supported in heraldic and highly decorative
manner by fluttering streamers and extended wings.
In those distant days there was no cavalry of the
clouds, to suggest a winged admirer in the Air Service.
So, knowing that my countrywomen are insatiable
collectors of the curious and the antique, I wondered
if this young lady had picked up in the <i>Spadaria</i>
some quaint bit of chasing and had adopted this
means of transporting it to her hotel.</p>

<p>As if to satisfy my curiosity, the young person
obligingly proceeded to seat herself near me on the
bench at the foot of the pier. I was thus enabled to
devote, at closer range, a covert examination to her
treasure. The human representation I accordingly
discovered to be that of Col. William Jennings Bryan,
as set forth by a legend on the fluttering streamers,
which contained further expressions with regard to
free silver and crosses of gold. I could not easily decipher
them without appearing to transcend the
bounds of delicacy.</p>

<p>The completeness of my disillusionment, and the
fact that a young and measurably attractive woman
should prefer ornaments of free silver to crosses of
gold—for which latter I have an especial fancy—led
me to consider my companion with more attention
than it might perhaps be decorous for a stranger to
betray. Her attire was that of a well-to-do person,
and she might have passed for one of good taste but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
for the ornament to which I have referred. That she
was of alert mind was evident from the incisive way
in which she looked about and then used her pencil
upon a small pad, as one making a sketch. I must
confess that I had some curiosity to see how St.
Mark’s would look to a virgin of political mind, and
I was so rude as to let my eye rest for a moment upon
her paper. To my surprise I discovered that she was
not sketching at all—or that, if she did so, it was
with words, and in some dialect to me perfectly unintelligible.
The characters with which she rapidly
covered her pad resembled those of the Arabic more
nearly than anything else with which I was acquainted,
unless they had about them something of
Scandinavian runes. Altogether I was completely
mystified. For whatever traits may distinguish the
American girl upon her travels, linguistic facility is
not one of them.</p>

<p>As we sat thus in uncommunicative companionship,
there approached us that familiar genius of St.
Mark’s, the blue and ancient sacristan who rattles
the collection box. Me he knew of old as a wanton
gentleman much given to passing half hours in the
golden church at the side of young and otherwise
unprotected ladies. At least I am sure he can have
attributed to me no motive other than that which
was likely to bring so many whispering couples of
his own nationality. Accordingly he approached us
with a smile of recognition and held out toward the
person at my side one of those cards with which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
is so inexhaustibly provided, representing the Nicopeian
Madonna. The admirer of Colonel Bryan
looked dubiously upon this offering. Finally, however,
she was won over by the old man’s irresistible
smile and accepted the papistical emblem. No
sooner had she done so than the sacristan, as is his
wont, produced the collection box, which from force
of habit he had kept behind him. At this the young
woman tried to hand back the card. But the old
man was occupied in passing the box to me, as in
such cases was also his wont. And from force of
habit I dropped in a coin. At which the cheerful
ancient bent his efforts in other directions.</p>

<p>The girl turned instantly to me, opening at the
same time the business-like black leather chatelaine
which hung at her side.</p>

<p>“How much was it?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” I said, “it was nothing at
all. I beg of you to put away your purse. Those
cards are distributed free. I merely put something
in because the old man and I are friends.”</p>

<p>She looked at me a moment with some intensity,
and then snapped her bag. It occurred to me that
her mind would sound like that—when she made it
up, as we say.</p>

<p>“How do you and the old man happen to be
friends?” she demanded rather abruptly. “Do you
live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, expressing the will for the deed.</p>

<p>“You speak English very well,” she commented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
regarding me much as if I had been a Bearded Lady,
or a glove worn by Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” I exclaimed. “That is a great
compliment, for I was born in Vermont.”</p>

<p>I suspected that my interlocutress did not altogether
appreciate this point. She continued to regard
me with such fixedness that I had an immediate
intuition of what she was about to say. She would
require of me to inform her why I lived abroad when
I was privileged to dwell in a country so far superior
to every other, and however ingenious might be my
pretence she would put me in the wrong. My intuition,
however, as too frequently is the case, was
mistaken. The young lady opened once more her
chatelaine bag, drew forth the receptacle from which
she had endeavoured to reimburse my expenditure
in her behalf, and produced a neatly printed card
which she handed to me. Upon this I read the
legend:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Miss Henrietta C. Stackpole</i><br>
THE OMAHA REVIEWER<br>
</p>

<p>I stared at this name in speechless amazement.
I had supposed Henrietta long married to Bantling,
and by this time the mother of an infinite progeny.
And Omaha! But, as I have intimated, much has
happened since 1881. And before I could frame some
manner of remark, my companion again addressed
me:</p>

<p>“I wish you would give me some information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be only too delighted, my dear Miss
Stackpole!” I assured her effusively. “I have heard
so much about you. This is my name”; and I offered
her my card in return.</p>

<p>“Where have you heard about me?” she demanded
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, from Mr. James,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Mis-ter James?” she repeated in deep mystification.
“I don’t remember any Mr. James. Oh, do
you mean Mr. Reuben James, of Topeka?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Henry James, of London,” I told her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any Mr. Henry James,” she declared
decisively. “He must have seen my letters
in the <i>Reviewer</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course!” I uttered, with considerable confusion.
“I beg your pardon. I thought——You
see——What information can I give you?”</p>

<p>“Well, would you mind telling me if this is really
Venus?” she asked confidentially, sketching a circle
in the ambient air.</p>

<p>I regarded my companion with no little uncertainty.
What finesses might lurk behind so intriguing a
question?</p>

<p>“Ve——?” But even as I began to repeat the
name, it flashed into my thick head that so had a
gentleman from California once denominated to me
some egregious Venice of his native State; and my
eyes opened very wide. “Why, yes,” I replied,
hesitating. “That is, if ‘Romeo and Juliet’ is
Shakespeare. I rather like the water, myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>While she neither agreed with nor challenged this
remark, I observed that it produced a visible satisfaction
in her. And she went on:</p>

<p>“I want to find out all about it. There’s simply
no end of things I want to ask—for my letters, you
know. I write for a syndicate as well as for the
<i>Reviewer</i>, and you’re the first person I’ve met that
I can really talk to. I hardly know where to begin.
What is this big building next door, for one thing?
It’s awfully queer looking.”</p>

<p>“It is rather queer,” I admitted. “The Patriarchate,
I suppose you mean? In the <i>Piazzetta dei
Leoncini</i>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any names, but I mean the checker-board
one, with piazzas all around and a picket fence
along the top.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I ejaculated, staring at her very hard.
“That is the Doges’ Palace.”</p>

<p>“What palace? These I-talian names are too
much for me.”</p>

<p>“Call it the Ducal Palace, then,” I answered, experiencing
a profound sensation. The young lady
thereupon applied herself anew to her pad; and it
dawned upon me that her strange alphabet might be
that of stenography. “I should think that you
would find a Baedeker convenient,” I added, discovering
that the intensity of my gaze had drawn
Miss Stackpole’s eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I’m bright enough to get around by
myself, thank you!” she rejoined with some irony.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
“I’ve travelled enough. This isn’t the first time I’ve
been to Europe, either—though it’s the first I’ve
been to Italy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! How I envy you! Think of coming
to Italy for the first time!”</p>

<p>There was something of voracity in the eagerness
with which I turned upon her. This was really too
good to be true. It was incomparable. When had
anybody ever come to Italy before without knowing
exactly what was expected of them? To my astonishment,
however, and no small dismay, the eyes of
Henrietta suddenly began to swim.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t envy me,” she said with a catch in
her voice, “if you knew how disappointed I was, and
what I’ve been through.”</p>

<p>She turned away a moment, as if to look at the
great swinging lamp in the form of a branching cross;
but I knew she was brushing her hand across her
eyes. An unaccountable contrition swept over me.
I responded, as sympathetically as I knew how:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Stackpole! I’m so
sorry. I am sure you must have been unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“I have been!” she exclaimed, turning to me again.
“I——” She stopped short a moment. Then—“You
probably think I’m queer, telling you all these
things; but you’re the first American I’ve seen for
’most a week.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mine, I assure you!” I declared.
“It is even longer since I have seen one.” I failed to
add what she might have found complimentary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
that seeing Americans was not what I came to Venice
for, and that I usually took pains to avoid them.</p>

<p>“Well,” she exclaimed, “it just does me good to
talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Have you been here long?” I delicately suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems as if it had been forever, but I
guess it’s only about two days.” Miss Stackpole
herself was evidently more mysterious than her little
pad. In spite of my sympathy for an unfortunate
lady I felt again an extreme curiosity to hear the
story of an original one. Before I had quite made
up my mind, however, as to how I might serve God
and Mammon with equal zeal, Miss Stackpole’s
overburdened heart solved the difficulty. “I’ve
been in London all summer,” she volunteered, “reporting
the coronation. But I got all het up, and so
I broke off and went to Switzerland. I lost big
money by it, too. I can afford it, though, and I got
a lot better.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are feeling quite right now,” I interposed.</p>

<p>“So far as my digestion goes, yes, thank you!”
she returned. “Well, I was just about ready to go
back, when I heard some people in the hotel one night
talking about Venice—if that’s the way they pronounce
it here. They’d left the day before, they
said, and they <i>were</i> going on, saying how grand it all
was. And the more I listened to them the more it
seemed as if I must come down here. Somehow I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
had no idea it was that near. I’ve always wanted to
see the place ever since I read about it in geography
at school. There was a picture of it, and underneath
it said: ‘Venice, a city of northern Italy, situated
upon 117 small islands in the Adriatic Sea.’ I
thought that was just wonderful—a hundred and
seventeen small islands! And I made up my mind
then that whenever I got the chance I’d come here.
So I started right off the next day. I knew all about
the I-talians, though, and I just made up my mind
I’d get ahead of them. I wasn’t going to land in their
country at night, and get robbed or stabbed or something.
There was a real nice German in the car, and
I found out from him which was the last station in
Switzerland and I got out there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor lady!” I cried. “You don’t mean
to say that you spent the night at Chiasso instead of
going on to Milan?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I did, if that’s the way you
pronounce it; but I don’t believe Italy itself could
have been any worse. The hotel was just the limit,
and they charged me more than Claridge does—in
London, you know. However, I managed to get on
to Milan the next day. And I like to have been
there yet.”</p>

<p>“What was the matter?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, when we had to change cars I couldn’t
make anybody understand a thing, and they were
all so black and horrid and murderous-looking that
I ’most wished I’d never tried to come. I was afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
they hadn’t put me in the right car, either; and I
hadn’t much idea how far it was, and at every station
I’d start up and look for the name because I
couldn’t understand a word the conductor said. But
as long as I didn’t see those hundred and seventeen
small islands I felt pretty sure I was right to stay in
the car. Once I almost got out, when we came to
some water with mountains all around—as blue as
blue! But there didn’t seem to be any islands, and
we went on and on, and it grew dark, and by and by
it began to rain and I didn’t know what I should do—everything
looked so watery and islandy outside.
Then the train stopped and a man opened the door,
and when I asked him if ’twas Venus he just took
my grip and dumped it out. I was that mad I would
have put it right back in. When I got out, though,
I saw we were at the end of the line—wherever that
might be. So, as it was pretty late to start off anywheres
else, I thought I might as well try my luck
and find out afterwards whether it was Ve—Venice or
not. But I don’t believe I ever would, for sure, if I
hadn’t met you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Beata Vergine!</i>” I murmured. “Can these
things be?” Then aloud: “Why, you seem to have
got on very well, Miss Stackpole, for one who didn’t
know the language.”</p>

<p>“Well, I always did manage to find my way around
pretty well,” she admitted. “But I never had a
time like this before. The getting here was bad
enough, but after I got here it was worse. I followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the people out of the station and I looked all around
for a hotel ’bus. That’s what I always do—get into
the slickest one I see, and then I land at a good hotel.
But I couldn’t find a single one. There were just
those queer boats. A good many people seemed to
be getting into them, too; but I didn’t like to, everything
was so dark and the men looked so horrid. I
didn’t know where to tell them to go, either. Then
I saw some more people making for a little steamer,
and I almost thought I’d try that. But I hadn’t
any idea where it might take me, and I thought it
was safer to stick to dry land. A whole lot of the
dreadfullest men kept saying things to me, though,
and tried to grab my grip, and I just about wished I
was dead. But I set my teeth and held on hard and
said over some things in good United States, and then
I began hunting for a decent-looking hotel near by.
It seemed as if I was sure to strike some big street if
I just walked on perfectly straight. That’s what I
always do when I get lost. But I couldn’t go straight,
to begin with. I just kept going round and round in
the worst little alleys that landed me up against a
stone wall or at the edge of the water or in some
creepy place where it was as much as my life was
worth to take another step. I got so tired and
scared I could have laid right down in the street
and cried.</p>

<p>“I’d made up my mind that I’d find a hotel,
though, and I did. I finally went up to a man that
looked something like a policeman, and I showed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
my bag, and said ‘Hotel’ real loud, several times.
He understood anyway, for he called a man with a
brass check on his arm, and said something, and
waved me along quite polite. I was pretty scared,
because I didn’t know but what the man would take
me off into one of those creepy places and cut my
throat. Nobody would ever find out. I was too
done up to mind, though. I just followed along, and
by and by we came to a cute little street that wasn’t
much bigger than the others; but it was real bright,
with stores, and lots of people walking, and so we
came at last to a hotel. It wasn’t a bit like the kind
of hotels I go to. I knew this was Italy, though, and
you couldn’t expect much, and I was that tired I
would have slept on an ash heap.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what hotel it was,” I said.</p>

<p>“It’s just near here,” replied my companion. “I’ve
got the name on a card, so I can show it to people if
I get lost.”</p>

<p>She resorted once more to her chatelaine bag and
produced a card on which I read the <i>réclame</i> of a very
grubby little inn occasionally patronised by travellers
anxious to practice an extreme economy. The sole
recommendation of the place is its antiquity. There
is not a window in it, I believe, or, if such conveniences
exist, their prospect is of the narrowest and
dingiest <i>calli</i>.</p>

<p>“They told me it was the oldest and best in town,”
said Miss Stackpole. “One of them knows a little
English.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it is conveniently located,” I assured her.
“I hope they have treated you right.”</p>

<p>“No!” Her voice died, and this time her eyes
flooded so quickly that I saw a splash before she
could turn. “You must think me a goose for going
on like this,” she said, raising her handkerchief.
“But it does seem good to find someone who isn’t
trying to do me out of my bottom dollar.” And
presently: “How can you live here, among such
people?”</p>

<p>The Venetians are with me a very tender point.
I have so long been a victim both of their wiles and
of their charm! But in the end it is the charm that
I remember.</p>

<p>“My poor Miss Stackpole,” I replied, “you have
been unfortunate. If some of them are pretty bad,
so are some people everywhere. And they improve
on acquaintance. Still, of course, it is the place that
catches one. Don’t you delight in it, now that
you’ve seen it?”</p>

<p>Henrietta cast her eyes doubtfully about.</p>

<p>“This church is pretty fine, though they do let it
run down the worst way. Just look at the floor!
And the square out there—it’s queer, but it’s nice;
especially looking off toward the water. But it isn’t
a bit what I thought. Those hundred and seventeen
small islands now—I sort of saw them lying around
in the sea, with palms and temples and things.
Don’t you know? I never expected these horrid
slimy little canals, and backyard alleys instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
streets, and such awful shiftless tumble-down
houses.”</p>

<p>I gazed at Henrietta aghast. Then I protested:</p>

<p>“But don’t you think many of the little alleys delightful?
And the squares, and the palaces, and the
carved windows and balconies, and the bridges, and
the shine of green below them, and the pictures, and
everything?”</p>

<p>Henrietta shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t been around any, except
just about here. I’m afraid. I don’t know why.
I’ve never felt that way before. But the little alleys
are so treacherous-like, and the people look so horrid,
and it has rained all the time, and—oh dear, I just
wish I’d never come!”</p>

<p>For a moment I thought that the dikes were down
and we were lost. But even as my knees began to
knock, Henrietta pulled herself together, dried her
eyes for the last time, and said:</p>

<p>“Now I feel a lot better—now that I’ve told you
all about it. Supposing you go ahead and tell me all
about things. I’m going to make this trip pay for
itself, if it doesn’t pay me.”</p>

<p>Could Henrietta have read my heart at that moment
she might have made a Bantling out of me
before I knew what she was up to. The idea of this
poor girl so realising the dream of her childhood—of
her stumbling blind into the loveliest city in the
world, and falling among thieves, and miraculously
escaping everything that there was of enchantment—moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
me idiotically. And not only did the pathos
of Henrietta move me. I was jealous for the honour
of my chosen city, whose peerless charms I have
been ready ever to maintain against any champion
and all.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Stackpole,” I cried, “you have
been unlucky! But you must let me help you to put
things right. I shall be your guide, if you don’t mind.
And first of all you must change your hotel. I know
of one which is just the place. Nobody will rob you
there, and everybody speaks English, and you will
meet any number of Americans, and your windows
will open into the Grand Canal.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” inquired Henrietta, grasping her
pencil.</p>

<p>“<i>Madre di Dio!</i>” I gasped. “Why, that is Venice!”
This was a banality justified by my companion’s
predicament. “Haven’t you been in a gondola yet?
A gondóla?,” I emended hastily, detecting a cloud in
Henrietta’s eye. “One of those boats?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered. “They looked so queer;
and then I didn’t know as I’d ever get back.”</p>

<p>“My dear lady!” I groaned. “This is too much!
Come out with me this instant to row in a gondola.
You haven’t seen the fingernail of Venice yet!”</p>

<p>Henrietta looked at me.</p>

<p>“You’re very kind,” she said slowly. “I don’t
know but what I will, later on. Just now, though,
I want you to tell me about things. I do want to get
those letters done. They are, pretty near.” I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
my face must have betrayed something, for she
went on: “Perhaps you think it’s funny for me to
write letters before I’ve seen much. But I’m made
that way, you know. I really don’t need to see a
place to tell about it. When I go into it, it sort of
comes over me what sort of a place it is, and I just
sit down and write it up as if I’d been all over. You
might not think so to hear me talk. I’m not much on
talking, same as business men who keep stenographers
aren’t much on writing. But I can write
two articles about the same thing, and you’d never
guess they were by the same person till you came to
the name at the end.”</p>

<p>I gazed at Henrietta with deepening interest.</p>

<p>“I hope you will send me your Venetian letters
when they come out,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“I will,” declared she courteously.</p>

<p>She thereupon proceeded to ply me with questions
the most diverse, the which for brevity’s sake I forbear
to transcribe. Each was more amazing than
the last, and when finally I found myself escorting
her to her hotel, I wondered whether, after all, the
rôle of Bantling would suit me. Nevertheless, I had
an extreme curiosity to hear her comments upon
those aqueous aspects of Venice which had as yet
remained concealed from her. I also took occasion
to stop at Zanetti’s and purchase a copy of Baedeker’s
“Northern Italy,” which I begged of Henrietta
to accept as a loan. I knew she would accept it on
no other terms, and I assured her that she would find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
it invaluable in putting her notes into permanent
form. She, thanking me warmly for my manifold
kindnesses, declared that she would be delighted to
accompany me in a gondola at three o’clock, when
her letters would surely be ready for the post.</p>

<p>When I called for her at the time appointed, the
porter informed me that the <i>signorina</i> had departed
on the half-past-two train. In the face of my incredulity
he then produced the new Baedeker and
the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Friend!</span><br>
</p>

<p>I must beg your pardon for giving you the mitten, especially
after you had been so polite. But I finished my letters <i>much</i>
sooner than I expected, thanks to your book, and after looking
same over there really did not seem to be much use in staying on.
So, as I have already found Venice <i>disappointing</i>, and as I heard
there was a train to Paris this afternoon, I decided to avail myself
of the opportunity.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">Thanking you again,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">Sincerely,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Henrietta C. Stackpole</span>.<br>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>I never knew him, myself. That is, in the ordinary
way of acquaintance. It was not that I
avoided him. It was, rather, that I was young,
and shyer than I might have admitted, and too self-conscious
on the point of <i>quid pro quo</i>. Time has
happily made me less squeamish about standing to
people in that relation which is not rare in this complicated
world, of finding them more interesting than
they do me. Even then, though, making people out
was for me the chief business of life. Whereas he
seemed to live in a world by himself. At any rate
he was far more fiercely individual than I, who am
Jesuit enough to get on with anybody. Another
point, however, was that I went to Marshbury those
three times only, for short periods and at long intervals.
The wonder was that he had made for me
so complete a picture as he did. But I think I never
saw anyone else so well through the eyes of others.
That is probably why I have never been back.
There was something final about that slab of grey
granite.</p>

<p>Mary Bennett was my principal source of information.
Everyone in the village had his quota to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
contribute, for that matter. But as Mary was Marvin’s
“help,” and as I boarded with Mary’s mother,
I enjoyed exceptional opportunities. Yet now that
I say it, I realise how indirectly it is true—how little
Mary ever told me in so many words. She was a
solid young person of seventeen when I first knew
her, really not bad to look at, and much better than
gold, but of a—what shall I call it? Indeed, I myself
was taken in at first. I used to wonder how much
help the girl could be. I was slower then to see how
factitious a part speech plays in the economy of life.
However, when I heard of the strange being to whom
Mary ministered, I prepared to be bored. I expected
the conventional ogre of the country village.</p>

<p>How he got that way—to dip into the dictionary of
the place—nobody knew. He was born and brought
up in the village, like his fathers before him for
two hundred years. Moreover most of them had
been divines, as the phrase pleasantly goes, and had
passed down the thunders of Sinai from one quaking
generation to the next. He certainly had enjoyed
every advantage. But as for Marvin, he would none
of them. It was an insoluble mystery. Mary was
the first to suggest that a circumstance of his early
youth might be connected with it—and a stepmother.
I rather balked at that. I have my own
ideas concerning stepmothers. But when I heard
about this one—! Marvin had come home from
school one afternoon when he was fourteen or so, it
seemed, and to his astonishment had found the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
empty. The only thing in it was his little trunk,
neatly packed and corded, standing near the door.
There was also a note, on the trunk. Reminding
him that he was now a man and had a man’s part to
play in the world, this missive assured him that whom
the Lord loved he chastened, urged him to gird up his
loins accordingly, and concluded by announcing that,
for reasons too sad and too numerous to mention, the
time had come for stepmother and stepson to part.
That, opined Mary, was in itself sufficient to harden
a lad’s heart—particularly in view of certain adventures
which were known to have succeeded the abandonment.
Mrs. Bennett, however, did not countenance
her daughter’s weakness. “Sary Marvin,”
contended that matron, “certainly don’ her share—pore
onfort’nit critter—toward bringin’ up Matthew’s
boy.” And the way he had got on in the
world ought not only to have vindicated the justice
of his stepmother’s confidence in him, but to have
convinced him beyond all shadow of doubt that the
Lord did provide.</p>

<p>Be that as it might, Matthew’s boy was certainly
provided for. It was but another discredit, however,
in the eyes of his contemporaries. To live without
toil was as open an invitation to Satan as it was an
unseemly example to the community. And, beyond
a mere exhibition of sinful pride, it was positively a
manner of bearing false witness. For there were
many and many that had more than he, and were
not above earning their daily bread. To be sure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
there was no infallible means of knowing just how
much Matthew’s boy had. He who was the opposite
of his neighbours in so many respects perversely
robbed the local bank of a considerable business, and
kept his money in Boston—where it made no difference
to anybody. And his cheques were so irregular,
and to such varying amounts, that the village
financiers had never made up their minds whether
Henry Marvin had ten thousand dollars or ten million.</p>

<p>But there were ways, I learned, by which you
could tell. For instance, Henry, he didn’t take the
newspapers and magazines. And everybody that
was half-way respectable subscribed to the <i>Marshbury
Messenger</i>. Henry didn’t seem to care much
about reading, except a few musty old things of his
own that were better left unread, most likely. Nor
did he avail himself of the other means of culture
which were open to the village. He didn’t even
patronise the lecture course. Such attractions as
they had, too—Dr. Waterman, the great Baptist
minister from York State, who lectured on “Oceans
of Pearls,” so beautifully that you’d never know he
was a Baptist; and the Orpheus Male Quartette;
and the Ladies’ Band, from Germany; and all sorts
of things! Altogether Henry didn’t spend much that
anybody could see, and he probably had less then
he’d like to make out, with that proud way of his of
doing nothing. And nobody knew, hinted my hostess
darkly, how he came by what he had, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>I am a scandalous gossip myself, and always encourage
other people in it. If one may put it without
circumlocution, there are few more precious sources
of copy. I must say, however, that the Bennetts did
not at first profoundly interest me with their revelations.
I did not even experience any unusual sensation
when I was told of Marvin’s prime enormity,
that he did not go to church. It was perhaps that
in a slightly wider orbit I had happened to hear of
such cases before. I had discovered that it by no
means argues an original spirit to discontinue that
for which one has no inclination. And the mere
doing or not doing what everybody else does will
rarely suffice to portray a man. The traits of life lie
deeper than that. The only thing about it that
struck me was that Mrs. Bennett called Marvin, in
consequence of his delinquencies, “a perfect pagan.”
And I put it down in my notebook as another instance
of the common use in New England of the
most unexpected words.</p>

<p>But I did prick up my ears at last. It was one day
when I expressed wonder—a purely conversational
wonder, let me confess in passing—that Marvin
should continue to live in a community with which he
no longer had any tie of blood or sympathy. Mrs.
Bennett thereupon informed me that Mary had more
than once asked him that very question—so far as I
could make out, she enjoyed strangely unconscious
terms of familiarity with him—and that he always
told her it was because of the brook. He lived, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
seemed, on the farm of his fathers, down near the
Poorhouse; and a brook ran through the place, inconveniently
cutting off a piece of the orchard just
behind the house. The noise of it would drive you
silly, said Mrs. Bennett—especially in the spring.
It never could make too much noise for Marvin,
though. He always made out that there was some
girl in it, singing to him.</p>

<p>That brook, and that singing girl, caught me!
The rest of it might have belonged to any retiring
old gentleman who was afraid of or bored by his
neighbours—not that Marvin was so old, though, I
came to find out. But this was of a distinguishing
quality. And it started me off on trails of curiosity
which rather indecently made up for my previous
indifference. I would have given a good deal to
meet the man. There was no one, however, through
whom the thing could be brought about in the ordinary
way of the world, and to approach him directly
was more than I dared. It was not merely that he
was older than I. He suddenly gave me an impression
of being more genuine; and I was ashamed to
go to him with no better excuse than a summer
boarder’s inquisitiveness. So I had to content myself
with getting at him through other people’s versions.</p>

<p>It grew into quite a little game just to make out
the deviation of each particular compass, and then
to chart the probable course. In the general opinion,
I quickly found, Marvin was mad. It was all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
saved him from open persecution. Could a person
be regarded as responsible who insisted that he heard
voices in running water, and who told the minister
to his face that there was more religion in an apple
orchard than in a church? And there were things
queerer still, intimated Mrs. Bennett. Mary could
tell about them.</p>

<p>What Mary could tell, what Mary did tell, most
of all what Mary did not tell, would make a story by
itself! It was such a case of the unconscious diversity
between character and opinions. I gathered that
among the reasons why the girl was allowed to serve
one so manifestly in league with evil was the hope
that her influence might be edifying. Certainly it
was for me, during the daily catechisms which she
underwent at the hands of her family. These, I was
informed in private, were intended to lay bare any
incipient work of contamination. Marvin’s money
was a welcome addition to the family exchequer,
but of course it could not be accepted if the girl were
coming to any harm. There was special danger,
said Mrs. Bennett, that Mary might contract habits
of intemperance. Marvin himself drank, and there
was no telling but what he would attempt as well the
corruption of his handmaid. He was as odd about
his drinking as he was about everything else, it
seemed. A particular upon which my informant
dwelt was that Marvin, instead of patronising the
drug-store like those who had legitimate uses for
strong waters, obtained his supply from Boston, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
he did his money. But there was something odder
still. The man had actually set up a regular bar in
his house, in a small entry between the sitting-room
and dining-room. He kept it stocked with liquids
of strange colours, and he had counters which he
could let down across the doorways.</p>

<p>“An’ he’ll be in the settin’-room,” went on Mrs.
Bennett, “an’ he’ll suddenly get up an’ say, ‘Good-evenin’,
Jack; can you fix me up a nice dry Martini?’—or
somethin’ or other like that. Mary’s heard him
lots o’ times. He don’t mind her bein’ ’round. An’
then he’ll walk around outside, through the hall,
into the dinin’-room, an’ so to the other door of the
entry. An’ he’ll say, same as if he was answerin’
himself, ‘Sure, Cap! I guess we can to-night.’ An’
then he’ll pour out his liquor, an’ put it down on the
counter, an’ walk around outside to the settin’-room
again. An’ then he’ll take up the stuff he left on the
counter, and taste it, an’ say, ‘That’s a good one
you made me to-night, Jack,’ an’ he’ll drink it up
just as if he was in company. He never seems to get
real drunk, though, so far as anybody can make out.
An’ he never tries to make Mary take any. He just
tells her he’d agree to do all the drinkin’ if she’d only
do the mixin’ for him, an’ that she’d save him a power
o’ steps if she’d only help him play his game.</p>

<p>“She’s don’ her best to stop it, but it ain’t no use.
She just stood up to him one day an’ quoted Scriptur’.
<i>Wine is a mocker</i>, she said; <i>strong drink is
ragin’</i>, said she, <i>an’ whosoever is deceived thereby is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
not wise</i>. An’ there’s a whole lot more in Proverbs
about they that tarry long at the wine, an’ look upon
it when it is red, an’ what not. But Henry, he took
her right up. ‘Yes,’ he pops out, ‘an’ what else does
it say? <i>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to
perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember
his misery no more!</i>’ Did you ever hear the likes of
that?”</p>

<p>I had to admit, on the whole, that I never did.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is strange how small a residue will be left by
how large a volume of life. Experiences that run
through weeks and months can be summed up at
last in an epigram. Not that I am one, let me say in
passing, who is given to that form of expression.
The thing done has for me no such interest as the
thing doing—to dip again into that dictionary. Yet
the rest of my summer in Marshbury added very
little to the picture which I have begun to sketch.
I had had my impression. I merely spent my time
turning it over, taking it in. And the most curious
thing was that, savouring the impression as much as
I did, I could go away and think no more about it.
I went away, and I stayed away three years. The
attractions of Italy for the time outweighed all
others. But after my “beaker full of the warm
South,” I had a whim to go back to Marshbury. To
speak in homely terms, I suppose it was on the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
principle that one likes a cold shower after a hot
scrub. At any rate, I am never so fond of the North
as after a prolonged sojourn in the South, or of
America as after Europe. And the picture of my
pagan came to me again more strikingly than ever—that
picture which would have been so impossible in
the country from which I returned, which was so of
the soil of that to which I went back. To Marshbury,
therefore, I proceeded; and, of course, for old times’
sake, I put up at Mrs. Bennett’s. Indeed I could
not put up anywhere else. They were all so a part
of the impression.</p>

<p>As for that, however—! I was not in the least
prepared for the changes it had undergone. I must
even confess that I was at first a little disappointed.
I somehow felt that Marshbury had not honourably
kept its tryst with me. So does one insist on opposing
one’s childish singleness of idea to the richness
of life! The background, to be sure, was exactly as
I remembered it. The hills looked just as they had
from the time of the Flood. So, I felt certain, did
the houses and the people. By whom I mean the
lay figures, the supernumeraries. And Mrs. Bennett
herself, who was no supernumerary, was good
enough to spare a shock to my sensibilities. But
that only made Mary seem the more unnatural. She
had suffered one of those metamorphoses to which
the young are so peculiarly susceptible—and which,
apparently, no amount of experience can ever teach
their absent elders to foresee. The curious thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
about it was that I could trace, after the event, how
impossible it would have been for her to turn out
otherwise. Even through her solidest days she had
always been prettier than she could help. It was
only natural that she should have grown up into a
handsome dignity that barely fell short of beauty
and stateliness. And while she was little freer of
words than she ever had been, she no longer gave
one the feeling that she stood in want of them. Altogether
she distinctly left me staring.</p>

<p>And she by no means put an end to it when, in
response to my inquiry as to whether she still went
to Mr. Marvin’s, she replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s got a girl now. He says she’s the one
who used to sing to him in the brook.”</p>

<p>This statement surprised but did not enlighten
me. I did not know whether to understand that the
Pagan employed a maid or was somehow in possession
of a daughter. It appeared, however, that the
latter was the case. And it furthermore appeared—at
least to my subliminal consciousness—that in
Mary a tacit forbearance with her master’s failings,
as being more of the head than of the heart, was less
unquestioning than it had been. It may have been
that I saw more than there was. I generally do. At
any rate, when it occurred to me to ask whether
Marvin still kept up his bar, I certainly touched
something. I could see it in the way Mary told me
that everything had changed since the girl came. I
felt for her. I felt, that is, as if some bungler had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
got hold of my rather original little sketch and had
finished it off in the conventional old fashion.</p>

<p>Marvin had a child. That was the bare fact. But
the full story I did not get then. Nor, for that matter,
do I suppose I ever shall. I did pick up one thing
and another, though, and the result of my pickings
I shall now attempt to set forth. It will take less
time if I do it in my own way. Particularly as I
have no love for the dialect in which my information
came to me. If Truth lie within that pale, let
me forever go without!</p>

<p>The affair must have caused a good deal of scandal
at the time. Marshbury took even less pride in the
possession of a Potter’s Field than in its lack of tenants.
And when a strange woman turned up from
somewhere, and had the ill grace to die in the Poorhouse,
people felt that their good intentions had been
imposed upon. Although they did grant that it was
the best thing the woman had ever done....
But the worst of it was that a shock-headed little girl
of nine or ten was left on the Overseers’ hands—a
small imp into whom her mother’s devil had returned
with seven wickeder than himself. It took no time
at all for the matron of the Poorhouse to shake her
head and sigh: “Blood will tell!” Indeed, she
openly expressed surprise that the Most High in his
mercy had neglected to take the child unto himself
at the same time as the mother. It certainly would
have saved Mrs. Lovejoy an infinity of trouble. The
mischief that child was not up to! She was as unmanageable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
as quicksilver. Her worst trick though,
was running away; and she had a passion for playing
in the brook of which no amount of whipping
could cure her. Time and again the countryside was
beaten by night, the brook dragged from one end to
the other, only to have her turn up safe and sound
and very hungry, without any idea where she had
been or what anxiety she had caused. Nothing ever
happened to her, either. It was so notorious that
Mrs. Lovejoy would often have been glad to let
her go, just to have the child off her mind.</p>

<p>It did not take this inquiring young lady long to
discover Marvin. Two causes operated powerfully
toward that effect. The first of them was that she
had been warned against him, as being the nearest
and most dangerous of her neighbours. The second
was that her brook ran through his orchard. Accordingly
she waded singing upon him one day as he sat
with his book under an apple-tree.</p>

<p>“Well!” he exclaimed, as the childish voice suddenly
stopped and he looked up to find a bare-legged
little apparition holding scant skirts in both hands
above the water. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m Sassy,” she answered, taking him in with big
black eyes. “That ain’t my real name, though. The
old woman says it ain’t Christian. My real name’s
Daphne.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” ejaculated Marvin. “Mary!” he
called to that young woman, who happened to be out
at the pump, “here’s the naiad of the brook come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
pay me a visit!” And to the child, who balanced
herself on a smooth stone while she splashed an overhanging
branch with her foot: “What old woman
is that?”</p>

<p>“Mis’ Lovejoy,” answered she of the unruly
hair.</p>

<p>“Lovejoy,” repeated Marvin. “Love-Joy. That’s
a nice name.” He was a little at a loss for something
to say. “Is she your mother?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” cried the child. “It may be a nice name,
but it’s all that’s nice about her. She’s just as horrid
as she can be. I hate her. She ain’t my mother a
bit. It ’most seems as if I never had any.” And she
began to visit upon the water a series of spiteful
kicks that spattered even Marvin’s page.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said he.</p>

<p>The two then looked at each other for a minute.
But it was the child who spoke first.</p>

<p>“What do you do?”</p>

<p>“What do I do?” queried Marvin, puzzled. “I
don’t do much of anything that I know of.”</p>

<p>“I mean what do you do that’s bad?” promptly
returned the child. “They told me I mustn’t ever
speak to you, because you’re bad. I’m bad too.
That’s why I came.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed Marvin. “Supposing you tell me
what <i>you</i> do.”</p>

<p>“Lots of things—tear my clothes, and muddy my
shoes, and sit in the grass, and climb trees, and slap,
and kick, and run away whenever I get a chance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Most of all, though, I play in the brook. Are you as
bad as that?”</p>

<p>Marvin held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Just about!” he told her. “But don’t run away
from here yet a while, Daphne—or turn into a laurel.
We have too many things to talk about, you and I.”</p>

<p>So it was that Daphne and the Pagan first cemented
the bonds of friendship. In the eyes of the unappreciative
community that harboured them, however,
it was but another point against them both.
If Marvin had known what pangs his small ally was
compelled to endure in his behalf, he would long before
have done what he did. For, as Mrs. Lovejoy
had ever been one to live up to her word, Daphne
spent an increasing portion of her days in cupboards.
She likewise became an expert on the elastic properties
of different domestic woods, and subsisted chiefly
on bread and water. But when not otherwise engaged
she spent all her time at Marvin’s, to the
despair and dismay of all in authority above her.
“Birds of a feather!” they ominously whispered.
Until at last things got too serious for whispers, and
Mrs. Lovejoy took matters into her own hands.</p>

<p>It must have been quite a scene. The rumour of it
still filled Marshbury at the time of my second visit.
Mary Bennett had been washing windows in the
kitchen, and I got the most authentic details. It
seemed that Mrs. Lovejoy swooped down like the
wolf on the fold, one afternoon when Daphne was
missing, and discovered the two, as she expected, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
earnest colloquy. She did not wait for preliminaries.
I must say I rather admire it, too—that trait which
will seek the point at any cost, without fear or favour.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you find in that child,” she
said to Marvin—“born of a common woman of the
street that’s buried in the Potter’s Field, and as full
of Satan as an onion is of smell! But when we’re
trying to do our best for her, it seems too bad that
you should come along with your heathenish notions
and just undo everything. I’ll thank you to keep
them to yourself. Sassy, you come along with me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” declared the child, roundly. And she
ran for refuge into Marvin’s arms.</p>

<p>Well, she stayed there. Of course there was a
tremendous row. Mrs. Lovejoy stormed, and Daphne
cried, and Marvin manœuvred rather helplessly
between. And the upshot of it was that Mrs. Lovejoy
retired ignominiously from the field, leaving her
adversary the somewhat astonished possessor of an
infant. Not that his title was uncontested. Mrs.
Lovejoy’s last word had been that she would put the
matter before the Overseers, and she did. If she was
a harsh woman, she was, according to her lights, a
just one. She did what she thought best in circumstances
which she was not subtle enough to understand.
Sassy was an intolerable incubus to her, but
for the good of Sassy’s immortal soul she thought
the waif should be saved from Marvin. After much
parleying, however, it was concluded to let the child
stay. She had been given her chance. The community<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
had done its duty. And its representative,
in the person of Mrs. Lovejoy, realised that, after
all, there was a limit to the endurance of flesh and
blood. It would therefore perhaps be allowable to
let the orphan go into hands that were ready to care
for her. The community promised itself that, under
this provision for the material aspect of the case, it
would keep a watchful eye on the child’s moral welfare.</p>

<p>I am not sure that the community did not envy for
Marvin a little moral discipline in the contract which
he so unexpectedly undertook. Certainly there were
distinct elements of humour in the situation. To
drop an incorrigible youngster into the arms of a
man who knew no more about children than he did
about the fourth dimension, and who had risen in
the morning without the faintest notion of adopting
one, might suggest very dubious results. But the
brilliant success of the experiment only served to let
in a little light on the ignorance of bachelors and the
incorrigibility of waifs. The pair entered upon a life
which became no less amazing to themselves than
to the community at large. People could not imagine
where the two discovered the secrets of virtue and
good humour with which they suddenly blossomed
forth. It amounted to another proof of their innate
perversity.</p>

<p>At all events, for the first time in many days both
of them were happy. They paddled unmolested in
their brook. They invented solemn mysteries about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
their relation to it. They climbed their apple-trees.
They dug their garden. They kept house—without
a bar. They told stories. They explored the countryside
for leagues around. Altogether they used
to make me wish, when I came to meet them on the
hills, that I could be a pagan too.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That opportunity, however, did not come to me.
The same train of circumstances which forced me to
leave Marshbury sooner than I expected kept me
away from it for the next seven or eight years. But
even though the impression which I have been recording
had lost a little of its early piquancy in
becoming more human, there was something about
that quiet corner of New England which always
stayed with me. In crowded streets I thought of its
open valley. Through the chatter of drawing rooms
I heard its running water. Among people sophisticated
to the vanishing point I remembered Mrs.
Bennett and Mary.</p>

<p>So, when the propitious moment arrived, I went
back to them. There was, I fear, a touch of the practical
even in my sentiment. I had started to scribble
a New England novel and I wanted to be quiet. I
therefore thought to kill the most birds with one
stone by returning to Marshbury. Be that as it
may, when I drove in toward the town it was
with an unaffected thrill that I suddenly recognised
the old feeling of the river road. I scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
know how to express it. There are indefinable
states of emotion, as distinct in their quality as
odours or colours. And only the surroundings
which awakened them first can, if ever, awaken
them again. This, I suppose, is the ground of that
principle of conservatism in man which can never
reconcile itself with the flux of the world.</p>

<p>My last visit ought to have prepared me for
changes. The drive, however, upset the inner counsels
with which I had fortified myself—and Mrs.
Bennett. She, immortal woman, was identically the
same being whom I had known eleven years earlier.
Even Mary had not changed so much between twenty
and twenty-eight as she had between seventeen and
twenty—although it was curious to me that the
effect of time should be so much more visible in the
one better able to resist it! The strong colour of
her girlhood had softened into that delicate bloom
which few but nuns can wear. And there was something
about her eyes that intrigued me. But I did
not wonder long. I had other sensations to take
account of. For in my ointment of happiness at
getting back I suddenly discovered a very large and
buzzing fly.</p>

<p>Not that the Reverend James Wentworth could
precisely be compared to that humble creature. I
had come, though, to look upon the Bennetts as my
private property, upon their paradise as open to myself
alone. And to find it invaded by the new minister
put my nose distinctly out of joint. Particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
as I perceived that my hostess fancied herself and
me greatly honoured by such fellowship. Of course
I could not be nasty about it. In other circumstances,
in fact, I might have appreciated it as much
as anybody. For I have an odd sympathy for young
clergymen. Without knowing very well how much
they deserve it, I always look upon them as among the
few really romantic people of the world—the people
who follow an inner light, regardless of rival luminaries.
But the Reverend James, alas, was of those
who carry the theory to its logical conclusion. He
was inalienably assured that his own inner light was
the sole reflection of Truth, and that all men else—with
whom he happened to differ—pursued false
fires.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous disillusionment, this unexpected
change of <i>milieu</i>. I had two ideas of leaving
on the spot. The new atmosphere, charged with
latent argument, was the medium in which I breathe
least easily. Being, however, more or less of a Jesuit,
as I have intimated, I merely fumed within—and
took copious notes. I promised myself that the Reverend
James should one day affront a wider audience
in the panoply of fiction. It was doubtless a lame
enough compromise. I have always envied those
single temperaments that can identify themselves
with one side of a cause. For myself, I am unable to
do it. I suppose I do not take things seriously
enough, or people. They come to me as cases rather
than as questions. I have no sense of responsibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
about them. At any rate, the case of the Reverend
James I proceeded to accept as an element of my
Marshbury impression. Little did I foresee how
sharply it was to throw into relief the other case with
which I had so long been occupied!</p>

<p>That had evidently grown more crucial with
the years—Marvin’s case. For Daphne was dead.
She had been dead almost four years, it seemed.
And in circumstances—One could not expect anything
but scandal where such people were concerned,
Mrs. Bennett told me. The only decent thing about
it was that she and the child had died together. Anybody
might have known that she would go wrong.
It was what she was born to. She had done it before
one could turn around, and just for a good-for-nothing
young scamp she hardly had time to get acquainted
with. Old Marvin, however, had refused to turn his
face from her. He had only kept her the more carefully,
and had been inconsolable since. Mary had
never known him so queer. But—</p>

<p>Yes, it was evident that there was a “but.” There
were things of another, a darker, kind: things which
were not so easy to put into words. Between Mary’s
eyes and her mother’s mysterious shrugs it was much
as ever that I succeeded in getting at what the business
was about. If it had not been for the plain-spoken
Mr. Wentworth—! There was a strangeness
to the thing, though, when I got it. There was a
strangeness which I never dreamed eleven years before.
It was only the stranger for the apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
conventional touches which my impression had in
the meantime received. But as I write of it I realise
Mrs. Bennett’s difficulty in speaking to me. It was
not a thing that you could say in so many words and
then go out of the room. You had to know the place,
the people, the circumstances. It was so largely an
effect of relativities, and of relativities different for
each person whom they touched.</p>

<p>It all began with Daphne’s death. Then Marvin,
who for seven years had been as much like other
people as he could be, said Mrs. Bennett, suddenly
turned more eccentric than ever. He refused to let
the girl be buried like a Christian, in the cemetery.
Of course she wasn’t one; but it was queer that he
should be the first to say so. He said the place for her
was between him and the water, and he made them
dig a grave in his own orchard—on a sort of little
mound there was beside the brook. If it had been
anybody else, the Selectmen would have stopped
him. But seeing it was that girl—! And instead of
getting her a proper tombstone, which he could well
afford and which everybody supposed he would do,
considering the store he set by her, he just planted
on her grave a sprig of lambkill.</p>

<p>That was natural enough in a way, opined Mrs.
Bennett. People like to put flowers on graves. But
lambkill! Laurel, he called it. He said that was
Daphne’s tree. It was all a part of some heathenish
business they had had between them. Mary thought
he got it out of his books. Anyway, he spent all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
time taking care of it. Of course it’s right to keep
graves looking tidy. But you don’t build little green-houses
over the flowers in winter. Neither do you
get up in thunder-storms, in the middle of the night,
to go out and attend to them. If the Lord intends
things to be taken care of, he takes care of them, in
spite of thunder-storms.</p>

<p>The strangest part of it, though, was something
more unnatural still—something almost supernatural.
The laurel sprig had followed for a time the ordinary
course of cuttings; had by sheer force of tenderness
been kept alive, and had at last developed into a
healthy little plant that could live alone. But then
of a sudden it received a new and secret impulse. It
began to grow as no laurel had ever grown before.
There was nothing like it in the whole country. It
outdistanced at a bound the humble shrubs from
which it sprang, and bade fair to rival even the great
mountain laurel of the woods. And such flowers as
it bore—such deep and burning clusters as never
would have passed for cousins, even, to the faint-flushed
wax of the lambkill!</p>

<p>The thing was unnatural enough in itself, Heaven
knew. But Marvin made it a scandal. It hardly
needed Mrs. Bennett to make it plain. He insisted
that Daphne had turned into a laurel, after all. He
called the bush by her name. He spent all his time
listening to the growing whisper of its leaves. He
said the strangest things to Mary about it—things
stranger than any he had told her in the days when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
he used to say that there was a girl singing to him in
the brook. A cult so extraordinary was not one to
pass unnoticed. Even if Mr. Wentworth had not
been in the village to formulate the moral issues of
the case, the miraculous laurel waved there on its
mound, more indecently conspicuous every day to
those who passed on the road. An uneasiness spread
among them. It was a reproach to Church and State
alike that such things should go on in their midst.
It corrupted youth and was an offence to age. Something
should be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth, accordingly, did it. He, like Mrs.
Lovejoy of old, went straight to Marvin. And again
I could not help admiring the simplicity of that attack.
I almost wished, too, that I might have been
present at the encounter. It must have been such a
contrast of types as one does not often witness in
this half-way world. But it was not difficult to
gather what happened. It was wonderful how
little Mary said, and how much she expressed!
Almost as wonderful were the volubility, the excitement,
with which Wentworth came back from
his interview.</p>

<p>“He is an enemy of God!” cried the minister.
“He professes to believe in God; but ‘he that is not
with me is against me.’ He has faith neither in
heaven nor hell. He denies the sacredness of Scripture.
He says a soul is nothing but a word—that
there is as much soul in a ruby or a rose as there is in
himself! And the kind of immortality he looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
forward to is worse than none. He is a perfect
pagan!”</p>

<p>The table rang with it for days. Of course it was
Mary who supplied the necessary additions to the
story. Incidentally, albeit unconsciously, she likewise
supplied additions to her own story of which I
had begun to feel a certain lack. Marvin had received
his caller courteously, it seemed; had even
consented, with a new quietness that had come upon
him, to listen to Wentworth’s exhortations. But
the poor zealous young man finally lost his head and
allowed himself to say that they both knew where
Daphne had gone, and it wasn’t heaven either. Well,
the minister departed rather suddenly, and Marvin
went out to his laurel tree.</p>

<p>With all this going on at the table, I found it hard
to keep up my Jesuitism. I was more than ever
caught by the case of this pagan who was the legitimate
child of a New England village. It was such
a strange example of the protean perversity of things
to melt into one another. Then the poetry of it
simply undid me. I sat there smugly writing New
England novels, but I could never have imagined
anything like this. And the trains it started off—!
Had that little tree indeed despoiled the secrets of
the grave? Had some taproot, blindly groping
through the dark soil, become a channel whereby
was made manifest the alchemy of the earth? Was
the laurel literally a transfiguration? Might it be
proof of the infinite resource of life that that unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
heart which life had broken should at once forget its
pain and dishonour and be transmuted into beauty?</p>

<p>To me more than ever the wind and the waters
spoke mysteriously. For me more than ever was
there a kinship between crystal and plant and creature
transcending the jealous immortality of man.
There was neither superiority nor inferiority. It
was all part of the unceasing life of the earth—of
that deathless ebb and flow which draws the ancient
elements again and again into new combinations,
which always has wrought with the same ones and
always must, in changing forms of beauty and
wonder.</p>

<p>And I came the nearest ever to seeking Marvin’s
acquaintance. He made me think of what Pater
says of Leonardo, who “seemed to those about him
as one listening to a voice silent for other men.” I
was interested to the verge of indiscretion. I even
went so far, I must confess, as to walk oftener than
elsewhere on the Poorhouse road—whence could be
seen the sacred laurel above its little stream. It was
indeed a prodigy. Such blossoms I never saw in my
life. It turned one’s head to see them there, aflame
among their glossy green, with the brook skirling
below. Mary told me that Marvin would never
pick them. Indeed he never picked any flowers
now, she said. It began the spring after Daphne
died, when the trailing arbutus came out. She had
brought him some, one day, thinking to please
him. But he asked her not to do it again. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
hurt them, he said. And they were Daphne’s
cousins, the arbutus....</p>

<p>I do not know how far I might have gone. But
there came a day when all hope of acquaintance was
suddenly cut off. There came a day! I shall never
forget it. I had been on a long walk in the country.
My book was stuck, and I knew of old that the only
way to unstick a book is to let it alone. So I walked
miles and miles in one of those delicious New England
afternoons of early summer when the air is an
elixir of eternity. It made me think of the Pagan
and it quickened in me a growing sense that the
earth existed as a whole and endured as a whole;
that men were but one phase of its immense secret
energy whose so-called consciousness had unbalanced
them a little, was merely another mode of an energy
more astounding still, as light and heat are but two
modes of vibrations which possess others undreamed.
It was for this reason, perhaps, that I came home by
the Poorhouse road.</p>

<p>As I rounded the turn by the orchard I looked as
usual toward the laurel tree. To my surprise, I saw
figures moving on the mound; and there was a cart
tied at the gate. It was so out of the ordinary that
I stopped in spite of myself. Then I suddenly discovered
that the laurel was gone! I could not believe
my eyes. The thing was too inconceivable. It was
to me as if I had stumbled upon a scene of murder.
In the first horror of it, in the certainty that something
terrible had happened, I forgot my habit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
taking no personal part in that village drama. My
unuttered feeling for Marvin caught me like a hand
and led me, choking, toward the mound.</p>

<p>All I had eyes for at first was the laurel. It lay
inert on the ground, that a few hours before had
waved so royally aloft; and already the magic flowers
looked a little wilted in their green. Beside it
crouched Marvin. He said nothing; but the inarticulate
sounds that came from him were the most
piteous I ever heard. And the way he caressed his
stricken beauty was more than one could bear to see.
No lover could more tenderly, more passionately,
address the limbs of his dead. He straightened out
contorted twigs. He lifted petals from their contact
with the ground. Now and again he put his hand to
the poor sawn trunk, whence a little pale moisture
was oozing, as if to stanch a mortal flow. And all
the while he kept by him the severed knot of the root,
with its one thick stem that had been broken off
deep in the ground.</p>

<p>After the first instant the indecency of looking at
such a spectacle overwhelmed me. I turned away.
I noticed Mary then for the first time. Two men
whom I recognised as farm-hands of the Bennetts
were also there, and another whom I did not know.
And Wentworth. Wentworth! All the shock of the
moment suddenly flared into my long latent dislike
of the man.</p>

<p>“Are you responsible for this?” I almost shouted
at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>I could have killed him, and he knew it. Yet that
certainty of right and wrong which is the power of
his type did not desert him. I had a sub-conscious
appreciation of it, so keen is my accursed sense of
such things, even in my fury.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered. “I am!” Oh, he was
not afraid or ashamed! He was of the stuff that has
kindled fires and fed them since the world began.
And he went on as if he had been in his pulpit—or
at the stake: “I have wished that this parish should
administer both rebuke and reparation. I have long
regretted that heathen rites should be tolerated in a
Christian community—as also that a proper charity
should not be shown to all, irrespective of creed. I
therefore took steps, after asking counsel of God, to
attain both ends. I cut down this tree because it
was a public scandal, an occasion of stumbling to
Christians and sinners alike. The very children of
our village were beginning to be infected by its
heresy. And I shall adorn the house of God with
these spoils, thus to expiate a sin and to consecrate
anew a work of God which has been devoted to unholy
uses. But I have not wished to be hasty in the
matter, to be needlessly harsh and wounding. Furthermore,
it has been my desire to make good a neglect
which has rested too long on the Christian conscience
of this community. I have accordingly taken
steps to mark with fitness the last resting-place of an
unfortunate young woman who apparently from her
birth was more sinned against than sinning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>He pointed behind him. Where the laurel had
been I saw now a slab of grey granite. And cut into
it I read these words:</p>

<p class="center">
DAPHNE MARVIN<br>
1894-1911<br>
<br>
“<i>He that is without sin among you,</i><br>
<i>let him first cast a stone at her.</i>”<br>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>And, like all serious patrons of the Good, the
True, and the Beautiful, we devoted our last
afternoon to the Spring Academy. Of course
it turned out to be as academysh as ever, and the
medals had as usual gone to people who deserved
them less than I. We therefore amused ourselves by
playing our favourite Academy game. The Academy
game consists in stalking haughtily by the obvious
pictures, eyes averted and noses on high, and in
darting with delight upon some forlorn hope, worrying
over it until everybody else comes to stare—when
you silently steal away. The success of this
game, I must admit, depends largely upon Nick.
For he has inches, hath Nick, and an air that overalls
cannot bottle up.</p>

<p>We had thus decoyed the multitude from the first
Hallgarten picture to a skied futurism that nobody
could make head or tail of, and were casting eagle
eyes about for our next pounce, when what should I
spy but the familiar signature of Zephine Stumpf!
I was feeling silly anyway, and the sudden recollection
of Zephine was too much for me. I collapsed on
to a sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Nick, ready for the coming
pounce.</p>

<p>I could only wag my head hysterically and wave
at the wall in front of us. It was enough for Nick,
however, who always had superhuman intelligence
and a catalogue.</p>

<p>“What is loose mit Zephine?” demanded he.</p>

<p>Nothing was loose with Zephine—except her
painting, as it ought to be. Her picture, as a matter
of fact, was very decent—some children, sketchily
but becomingly dressed in splashes of sunlight, in
an orchard. Zephine had been painting pink infants
in sunshiny orchards ever since I first knew her in
darkest Greenwich Village—when she could get hold
of the orchard or the infant—and this was quite the
best of the lot. But I could only gibber like an imbecile
and wipe my streaming eyes.</p>

<p>Nick gave me up as a bad job. He proceeded to
examine the picture. He looked at it from one side,
he looked at it from the other side, he poked his nose
into it to see how it was painted, he cocked his eye
at it from across the room. Finally he came back to
me.</p>

<p>“You can have delirium tremens till you’re black
in the face, if you choose,” he announced, “but I
like Zephine. I’m going to buy her.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” I managed to hiccough. “She
deserves it.”</p>

<p>“But why do you go on about her like a demented
cockatoo?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“It’s only her—her clothes!” I snorted, going off
again.</p>

<p>Nick went off too—to the Secretary’s office. And
he presently returned, brandishing a receipt at me.</p>

<p>“There now! She’s mine and I shall stand up for
her!” he exclaimed. “Why, species of a beast, do
you make fun of a sister brush’s clothes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t make fun of them,” I retorted. “I always
admired them very much. Only——” I had to
stuff my handkerchief into my mouth lest my inept
cachinnations profane anew the decorous shades of
the National Academy of Design.</p>

<p>“Only what, animal?” pursued Nick severely.</p>

<p>“They were so—so original!” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Original? How can anyone’s clothes be original?”
inquired Nick. “I have tried all my life to
invent original clothes, and never achieved anything
more original than when I was young enough to induce
a scandalised tailor to sew blue serge with green
thread.”</p>

<p>“Well, hers were,” I insisted. “And do you have
the courage to tell me, Nick Marler, that you never
saw them—or heard of them?”</p>

<p>Nick signified that such was the case. And at the
thought of what lay before me I was near erupting
again. But Nick held me to sanity with a cold grey
eye.</p>

<p>“I suppose she wasn’t very well off,” I began.
“None of us were, of course. And I suppose she
must have had some German philosophy in her system.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Her people came from Halle. So she set about
solving the problem of dress. She said no woman
could begin to dress who hadn’t at least ten thousand
a year to do it on. For other women, then, the
only thing was a sort of uniform—like postmen, or
peasants. She really would have liked the costume
of Thuringian village girls, she said, but was afraid
it might be too conspicuous for New York. She
therefore evolved a uniform of her own—always the
same thing for the same time of day.”</p>

<p>“Very sensible, too,” put in Nick.</p>

<p>“The real beauty of it, though, was its compactness.
She only kept three or four things
going, and they were all”—I caught my breath—“reversible.”</p>

<p>“Reversible! How do you mean reversible?”</p>

<p>“How do I mean reversible? I mean reversible.
I remember a certain brown skirt in which I oftenest
saw her. When Zephine went to a party, Nicholas,
what did Zephine do? Zephine turned her brown skirt
inside out, Nicholas, and then it suffered a sea-change
to a pea-green rich and strange, Nicholas,
with brown leather bindings and big silver buttons—for
<i>Schönheit’s</i> sake.”</p>

<p>The madness began to flicker again within me.
But Nick, out of the perversity of his heart, refused
me the shadow of a smile.</p>

<p>“What else had Zephine?” queried he.</p>

<p>“What else had Zephine?” echoed I, nettled at
Nick’s gravity. “Let me see. Zephine had else a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
creation of écru silk, which in conjunction with the
pea-green skirt and the leather bindings and the
silver buttons completed her effect of splendour for
varnishing days and studio teas. But minus the
pea-green skirt it might be a morning dress, or a
painting apron, or a dust cloak, or—who knows,
Nicholas?—perchance a robe of night.”</p>

<p>Nick looked at me and I looked at Nick.</p>

<p>“Do I shock you, my Nicholas? Nicholas mine,
be not shocked. You know the morals of Greenwich
Village, how milk-mild they are, as compared to its
scarlet conversation. And Zephine never made any
bones about the secrets of her toilet. She had, for
instance, a——No, Nick; I cannot pronounce it.
You gaze at me too solemnly, and we are surrounded
by too many of what you would call the best people
in New York. Very likely you’re right. It is not
given me to read their hearts. But it is given me to
inform you that Zephine also had a shiny grey skirt
of state, of super-state, which by means of unimaginable
buttonings, hookings, loopings, and heaven
knows what, transformed itself at will into a blouse
or an opera cloak. And she had only one hat, which
in summer was a sailor and in winter a sort of Turk’s
turban. The other girls said she was always urging
them to go and do likewise.”</p>

<p>I giggled to myself at the remembrance of it.
But as for Nick, he obstinately continued to frown
upon me like a Spanish inquisitor.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he pronounced at last. “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
know whether you’re drawing on the recollections
of an extremely lurid past, or whether you’re being
visited by the divine afflatus. But it strikes me that
you’re more amused than anyone else. It also
strikes me that this is a pretty sleazy line of stuff
for one man to pull or another to listen to.”</p>

<p>With which Zephine dropped abruptly from our
conversation.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Having done his duty by the arts and crafts of his
country, Nick was suddenly moved, on that eve of
his departure, to go miles uptown—to Washington
Bridge. He has rather an eye, Nick. I had forgotten
how the tall arches of High Bridge stand up
against the bright water and smoking gold of a Harlem
sunset. It was better than the Academy, if I do
so say who am a slave of the brush. And it inspired
us to pick up a dinner somewhere in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether it was because the place
was German or whether it was that the proprietor
produced for Nick such a Moselle as you didn’t come
across every day even in that faraway year. But as
we sipped the last of it and debated how we might
worthily spend our last evening on our native shore,
Nick casually proposed:</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see Zephine.”</p>

<p>I am not usually the one to lag behind. But Nick
had refused, with opprobrious implications, to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
with me, and it seemed good to me to refuse to play
with Nick.</p>

<p>“Come on, Herb,” he persisted. “Don’t be a
spotted zebra. Let’s go find Zephine.” And he
called for the bill.</p>

<p>“How on earth do you propose to find Zephine at
this time of day—and we sailing for Norway at ten
to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“Where do you think I was born—Island Pond?”
inquired Nick suavely. “There’s a telephone book
in front of your nose, and a directory beside it. In
addition to which I might remind you that her address
was in the catalogue.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” I asked. I knew in my reluctant
soul that if Nick had made up his mind there was no
use sulking.</p>

<p>“O, Corlear’s Hook some place,” answered Nick,
charming the heart of an anxious-looking waiter—if
the heart may be charmed by that which is put
into the hand.</p>

<p>“Corlear’s Hook!” I exclaimed. “She’s moved
then, though it sounds enough like Zephine. But
it’s some way from Washington Bridge.”</p>

<p>Nick didn’t mind, however. Neither the taxi man
who presently undertook to jounce us from one end
of Manhattan Island to the other. And I am happy
to add that we ran over no one on the way, though
we did run out of gasoline. Incidentally Nick
soothed my ruffled feelings by making me tell him
about Zephine all over again. I fancied, though, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
was really the Corlear’s Hook that caught him. He
made me promise that I would say nothing to Zephine
about the picture.</p>

<p>At Corlear’s Hook there was no Zephine. It
wasn’t that she was dining out, or anything so simple
as that. She had gone up to paint at Fort Lee,
in a farmhouse whose whereabouts the janitor
endeavored to make plain to us in the accent of
Warsaw. To Fort Lee we accordingly proceeded, to
the vast delight of the taxi man. Luckily it was a
moonlight night, or we never would have succeeded
in tracking Zephine to her farmhouse. As it was,
we nearly tumbled off the Palisades a dozen times.</p>

<p>I have no idea what time of night it was when we
finally floundered through an orchard to Zephine’s
dark and silent lair. I bet Nick she wouldn’t be in
it. Nick bet me she would. She was—fast asleep
in bed. But we routed her out, and she parleyed
with us through a window while we kicked our heels
on the edge of the piazza. It was rather like the
third act of “Faust”—except that Zephine was a contralto.
She had a pleasant gurgle in her voice that I
had forgotten. She also had the proper yellow braid
over her shoulder, if not two of them. And the
whole place was operatic with apple blossoms and
moonlight.</p>

<p>Many ladies might have betrayed a certain surprise
at receiving a visit at an unknown hour of the
night, in a New Jersey orchard, from a New York
taxicab and two men of whom they had never seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
one before in their life. Not so Zephine. She accepted
it as perfectly natural that I, who had not
seen her for longer than either of us could remember,
should feel irresistibly impelled to bid her farewell
before sailing for Norway, and that Nick, whose
name she had apparently never heard, should pay
this somewhat unusual tribute to a lady whose work
he had happened to admire.</p>

<p>In token of his admiration Nick invited her to
join us in a little drive—at this I heard a snicker
from the direction of the taxi—and help us pick up
an ice on the way. Zephine judicially considered
the matter, stroking one of her Marguerite’s braids,
but eventually opined that she would better not.
She had models coming at sunrise, and she couldn’t
paint if she were sleepy.</p>

<p>“O!” sighed Nick in evident disappointment.
“Couldn’t you put your models off? What I really
hoped was that you would get a little acquainted
with us, or with me, and consent to go to Norway
too.”</p>

<p>That was what I heard Nick Marler say, in Zephine’s
moonlit orchard, swinging his long legs off her
rickety little piazza! And I listened for her answer
with my mouth open. For I knew she was perfectly
capable of taking Nick at his word. Her deep gurgle
however, reassured me.</p>

<p>“That is awfully nice of you, Mr. Marler. If I
had sold my picture in the Academy, I might. But
as it is, I’m afraid Norway is not for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“O, I didn’t mean that!” cried Nick, secretly giving
me an infernal pinch of reminder. “I do hope you
won’t think me rude, or anything like that. But
Herb here is going as my guest, to give me his expert
opinion on some old enamels we have an idea of
hunting up, and we’d be ever so pleased if you’d be
good enough to come along too and make one of the
jury.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>She went!</p>

<p>Reader, whom I feel it unworthy to cajole by the
use of any epithet so simple or so designing as gentle,—reader,
I who went too, I who heard, who saw, and
who now narrate, do not profess to have the charcoal
sketch of a notion how we really embarked on our
fantastic adventure. I therefore feel somewhat
hopeless of communicating it to you, or of convincing
you that you have not unwittingly been seduced into
starting a story unfit for ladylike or gentlemanly
ears. To charge it to the account of the Moselle,
however, is what I refuse. I can only propound the
thesis that the geography of “this goodly promontory,”
the unstable planet whereon we spin, has as
yet been imperfectly mapped out. I am unable, at
all events, to accept the popular theory that its surface
face is divided between the World and the Half
World. Even you, epithetless reader, have heard of
a tract lying between the two, and overlapping them
both, vaguely designated as Bohemia. But my
own mild explorations have convinced me that Bohemia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
is a name not comprehensive enough for a
certain dark intervening continent of which are
denizens my very good friends Nick and Zephine.
And I hereby invite you, if not to comprehend their
case, at least in a spirit of tolerance to consider the
same.</p>

<p>Do not expect me, therefore, to fill up valuable
space by assuring you in so many words of Zephine’s
epic simplicity, or of Nick’s romantic freedom to do
whatever came into his head. He told me afterward
that when he saw our friend and her braids and the
apple blossoms and everything, he just had to find
out whether I had been lying about her; and if she
hadn’t agreed to go with us he would have cancelled
our passage.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he did. Not many hours after
our return from Fort Lee he sent me off by myself to
get Zephine. “And by the way” he added, just as
I was starting, “come to the Cunard pier.”</p>

<p>“What pier?” demanded I in astonishment.</p>

<p>“The Cunard,” he repeated. “We shall get over
quicker by the <i>Pactolia</i>. And it may amuse Zephine
more.”</p>

<p>I, who am of the submerged tenth, had been dying
to cross by the latest flier. But Nick, who won’t—or
who wouldn’t—have a yacht because it’s duller
and less comfortable, has a passion for discovering
boats that nobody ever heard of, by which queer
people take forever to get to out of the way ports.
He had therefore engaged passage on a line that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
sails to Christiania—when it doesn’t hit some outlying
portion of Scotland and go down with all on
board. It was on the tip of my conventional tongue
to object that we were too late to get anything by
the Cunard or any other line than our own, three
hours before the ship was to sail, in the migrating
season. I have travelled with Nick before, however.
He is not like me, credulous enough to believe steamer
agents and hotel clerks and sleeping car men when
they solemnly swear they haven’t a berth left. He
always insists, on some dark theory that what they
really prefer is not to sell out, that they’ve got something
up their sleeve. And heaven has gifted him
with the art of getting it down.</p>

<p>And so it was on this memorable occasion. Zephine
and I arrived at the foot of Fourteenth Street
at three minutes to ten, purple and panting but still
on speaking terms. For I had all but abducted her.
At the decisive moment I had discovered in this
emancipated lady a scruple. She was calmly painting
in the orchard, and before she would dismiss the sunrise
models, or pack her straw suitcase, it became
necessary for me to prove to her that Nick could
take the entire Academy of Design to Norway every
summer, if he chose, and still have enough left for
enamels. However, we were hustled by that gentleman
aboard the <i>Pactolia</i> just as the gang-plank
went up. Zephine and her straw suit-case were installed
in an ivory-and-gold royal suite which had until
the last moment been reserved for a Cattle Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
of the South-West, her retinue, and her wardrobe
trunks. But the Cattle Queen had been so imprudent
as to indulge in an excess of Nesselrode pudding,
plus Crême d’Yvette, during the fated hours that
Nick and I were taxying around New York and
New Jersey. We contented ourselves with the captain’s
cabin—Nick vowing they had another somewhere
and would cough it up as soon as they started.
Which, in fact, they did. But as Nick wouldn’t let
me take it, and I couldn’t let Nick, I suppose the
captain must have slept there instead of in the
steamer chair with which Zephine’s sympathetic
imagination endowed him.</p>

<p>I have been lucky enough to cross the ocean as
often as most people, and oftener than some; but I
never made a voyage like that. The howls with
which I had greeted Zephine’s reappearance on my
horizon were constantly upsetting my equilibrium.
While I have enough in common with her and Nick
to travel in their company even to this day, I also
have too much in common with Mrs. Grundy not to
be conscious how horrified she would be when it
came out, through the pronunciation of names and
the confidences of stewardesses, that the lady of the
royal suite was not the famous Cattle Queen of the
sailing list but a simple damsel of the brush, voyaging
under the protection of the far from obscure Mr.
Nicholas Marler. Such cases, of course, are not absolutely
unknown on ocean greyhounds. The beauty
of this case was its perfect difference from anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
good Mrs. Grundy was capable of conceiving. And
what a picture-play I could make out of it if I had
the time!</p>

<p>Zephine’s clothes were naturally what interested
the more inquiring of our fellow passengers. Yet
the glances which followed our companion were not,
I noted, of disdain. I concluded that the royal suite
of the <i>Pactolia</i> lent Zephine’s uniform a new value,
or at any rate gave her a freedom to wear what she
chose. For she was good enough to justify my account
of her. Having marked out a sartorial course
for herself, Zephine had never wasted time in
reconsideration. She duly produced the brown skirt, or
the pea-green, or the shiny grey, as occasion
demanded. And each was a pure delight to Nick, who
couldn’t get over her. But he had had the flair to
know, which I hadn’t, that Zephine would not suffer
by comparison with the laces and jewels of the saloon.
It surprised me, in that company, to discover
what an air she had. She had been through the mill
of the studios, of course, and it would take a good
deal to startle her. In fact she sometimes startled
more delicately nurtured dames by the things she
took for granted. She was not Marguerite, though.
She was nearer Juno, in her large, fair, easy, Germanic
way. Her braids were magnificent in the
light. As for her throat and her shoulder, they were
incomparable.</p>

<p>“Really Nick,” I burst out one night, “you are a
born connoisseur. Did you know, or were you mad—just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
seeing her like that, in a window, for a quarter
of an hour, in the moonlight?”</p>

<p>Nick’s rejoinder, which was no reply, edified me
to the limit of edification.</p>

<p>“She says they wash,” he seriously observed.</p>

<p>My jaw dropped, for only to the wise is a word
sufficient. But then I howled anew.</p>

<p>“Of course they wash, you cracked walnut! That’s
the killing part of it, because she doesn’t save anything
by her famous system—she has to keep so
many of them going.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ever marry her?” continued
Nick inconsequently.</p>

<p>“I never thought of it, for one thing. Neither did
she, for another. If she had, she scarcely would have
failed to mention it. And neither of us could afford
it, for a third. Want any more reasons? I can
think them up as fast as you can ask them.”</p>

<p>“Herb, you’re an ass,” commented Nick without
forms. “But it’s never too late to mend. We’ll
build a Norwegian cottage in the lake orchard at
Island Pond, and you can both paint apple trees and
live happily ever after.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said I.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was great fun showing Norway to Zephine.
They went very well together. Norway is the least
conventional of countries, where you have the most
room in which to swing cats. There is nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
look at but Norway itself, and you aren’t overrun by
fellow bearers of the red book. It doesn’t distress
me a bit that the mountains are only half as high as
the Swiss ones. They are twice as effective when they
climb sheer out of still green fiords. That is the great
point about Norway, of course—the water, and those
fingers of the sea feeling for leagues among the
mountains. And the peasants are quite the most
perfect among peasants, if a shade too honest.</p>

<p>Zephine was entranced by everything, from our
first view of the Christiania Fiord. That’s too much
like Island Pond to suit me. However, disdaining
trains, boats, and the outcries of the Grand Hotel, we
embarked in three of those funny little carts, drawn
by three of those fat friendly little ponies, and travelled
post—when we could—across to the Hardanger
Fiord. When we could not, we walked. We nearly
froze to death, too, in the high fjelds, just as the
Grand Hotel had promised with tears in its eyes.
But Zephine and I made no end of sketches, and
Nick got no end of ideas for cottages—with arches
of rough stone, and outside stairs, and loggias of
carved wood, and roofs overgrown by turf and pansies
and bluebells. We also picked up, out of such
cottages, some old silver that made our eyes pop out
of our heads. Altogether we had the time of our
lives.</p>

<p>We hardly saw a tourist the whole way. Consequently
we were surprised enough to drive into
Odde one evening, at the head of the fiord, and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
told there was not a room in the hotel. We might
have expected it, for the time was just when people
flock to the North Cape. And there was no other
hotel in the place—which then consisted of two or
three cottages and a pier. Nick, however, took his
usual course with the landlady. He blandly persisted
in demanding three rooms, until the landlady
produced them. Very good rooms they were, too—or
at least mine was. It looked out through festoons
of blossoming honeysuckle into a little garden, and
beside it a river ran gaily into the long avenue of the
fiord, whose rocky walls were still gilded by the late
summer light. As I stood there, looking and listening
and sniffing, an old lady stepped from a wing of
the house to make a last touch of local colour with
her wonderful white cap, which stood out frilled
and starched around her head like an aureole.</p>

<p>Still more wonderful, in his way, was a man whose
acquaintance we struck up at dinner. He was an
Angle, though he might have been a Saxon. He was
all pockets, and he travelled with everything he had
in the world in them. You never saw such bunches
in such unexpected places. Some of the pockets
were too inaccessible for him to get at without taking
off his clothes; so he had bags inside of them, detachable
by means of tagged strings which hung within
reach. He showed us some of the things in the bags—rocks
and weeds and beasts of the field. For the
man was by way of being a naturalist. And his back
was so stiff and so flat that you couldn’t conceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
what was the matter with him, until you learned
that somewhere in it he kept a life-sized atlas!</p>

<p>“Nick,” I observed after a hilarious evening, as
we stood in my window looking at the twilight of the
gods that hung in the fiord, “a crown of righteousness
shall be laid up for you on high. You have
made Zephine’s fortune.”</p>

<p>“O?” he grunted noncommittally.</p>

<p>“That Englishman! I see it all. They were
formed by heaven for one another. It’s a case of
<i>coup de foudre</i>, as the alienists say. We shall have to
go home without Zephine.”</p>

<p>“Herb,” remarked Nick, turning his back on the
twilight of the gods and on me, “your inside is as
baroque as that bird’s outside. Stop being a
pickled peacock, if you can, and go to sleep.”</p>

<p>It was not written, however, that slumber should
instantly visit our eyelids. We presently became
aware of a tremendous commotion downstairs. We
then became aware of the cause of the commotion.
The commotion was caused, as no one in the house
could help learning in the broken and squeaky English
of its fount and origin, by no less a personage
than His Serene Highness the Prince Ernst Paul
XXIII of Waldeck-Hohenkugel, who had reserved,
as it appeared, the very rooms which Nick had pulled
out of the landlady’s sleeve, and who clamoured that
those rooms be delivered up to him at once. The
landlady, good woman, had made her bed and she
lay in it. She refused at all events to turn us out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
ours, arguing that no reservation held after dinner.
And she liberally offered his far from serene Highness
his choice of bath rooms, billiard rooms, reading
rooms, drawing rooms, or dining rooms. His Highness
rejected them all, very profanely, and vowed he
would go on to the next post-station. But as there
happened to be no road to it except by water, and
as no steamer would leave till morning, he was forced
to accept what hospitality the landlady proffered
him. So silence descended at last upon the solitudes
of Odde.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When I unwillingly came back to consciousness I
thought His Serene Highness must be getting under
way again. Then I didn’t know what to think. For
who should be at my chaste bachelor bedside, shaking
me vigorously and shouting something about
Nick, but Zephine. It didn’t take me long, however,
to make out a strong smell of smoke, a most unpleasant
glare, and horrid sounds of crackling.
What happened next I don’t quite remember. We
only just had time to run for it. You have no idea
how quickly a small wooden hotel can burn up at
two or three o’clock of a cool June morning. There
turned out, thank heaven, to be no casualties.
But there were some pretty tight squeezes. And
nobody saved much of anything.</p>

<p>As the flames died down and the survivors began
to regard each other in the cold light of day, we presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
one of the most inspiriting spectacles I ever
hope to admire. It made me think of what I have
heard described in rural regions as a white shower.
The only completely dressed persons in the party
were a few sympathetic citizens of Odde, plus my
old lady in the white cap and the Englishman of the
pockets. A fairly complete exhibition of the night-wear
of civilisation was there, hovering for warmth
in the neighbourhood of the smoking ruins or lurking
for privacy in an orchard I had not noticed the evening
before. There were a few blankets and counter-panes
in the assembly. Some had clutched odd
garments as they fled, and now retired behind apple
trees to put them on. One lady had had time to
rescue her hat—“only this and nothing more.” A
squire of two dames had clothed one of them in his
dinner-jacket and the other in the waistcoat appertaining
thereto. He himself boasted a pair of pumps
and a Baedeker. As for me, I discovered myself to
be the happy possessor of a pair of trousers and a
travelling rug. The latter in particular was highly
comforting, in the air that drew down the valley from
the white fjelds.</p>

<p>I likewise discovered, however, that with the rest
of my belongings I seemed to have lost my companions.
I had been so diverted, for a time, that it
did not occur to me to be uneasy about them. And
I was unable to imagine that two such competent
persons would ever allow themselves to be roasted
alive. I began, though, to wonder what had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
of them—when in the wearer of a splendid Persian
dressing gown I suddenly recognised Nick. We fell,
so to speak, upon each other’s necks.</p>

<p>“But where is Zephine?” we simultaneously demanded.</p>

<p>She could scarcely have come to any harm, for
she it was who rescued us both. And we both vaguely
remembered having, in our excitement, seen her
afterward. But where on earth was she? And, poor
wretch, in what condition?</p>

<p>Just as we were setting forth to find out, we were
arrested by a loud and lamentable “<i>Ach Gott!</i>”
This outcry enabled us, indirectly, to identify the
Prince of Waldeck-Hohenkugel. I had first picked
out for that nobleman the most distinguished looking
person present, a blond and curly-haired Apollo who
stalked about with an air of proprietorship, classically
draped in a sheet. But a squeaky voice, issuing
in response to the “<i>Ach Gott!</i>” from an unnaturally
distended suit of purple pyjamas, rebuked my
ingenuousness. His Highness, less serene than ever
and now past all power of English, nevertheless took
us at once into his confidence, pouring out the history
of his woes from the moment of his arrival in Odde,
and intimating that the fire was a just judgment
from on high upon an unrighteous <i>Wirthin</i>. As for
the princely consort, she shivered in the lee of an apple
tree and refused to be comforted. She had reason!</p>

<p>I looked at Nick and Nick looked at me. We had
not much more cause for happiness than those disillusioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
pleasure seekers. Nor had we burned the
roof over their heads. Yet we had, as it were,
snatched the pillows from under them. Moreover
we could not help being conscious that our own case
was less dire than theirs, and that one of them was a
lady. So Nick, like a hero, took off his Persian dressing
gown. I, not to be outdone, divested myself of
my English travelling rug. As one man we advanced
toward the princely apple tree, whose branching
trunk intervened between us and the shrinking
Serenity of Waldeck-Hohenkugel. And each of us,
holding out at arm’s length his offering, invited Her
Highness, in a strange mixture of tongues, to accept
the same.</p>

<p>Her Serene Highness—such is the inconsistency of
womankind—eyed us through the fork of her apple
tree with no little confusion. In the candle-light of
her ancestral halls, or even in the sunlight of the
beach at Swinemünde, she would have been unconscious
of exposures more expansive than she now
presented. But to parley, under a Norwegian apple
tree, in a single voluminous garment of white, with
two honourably intentioned gentlemen in pyjamas,
seemed to shake the serenity even of a mediatised
house. Yet that Her Highness’s emotions were of a
complex nature was patent from the hungry glances
which she cast, now upon the English travelling rug,
now upon the Persian dressing gown.</p>

<p>I know not how long this painful scene might have
been drawn out, had it not been for Zephine, our lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Zephine, who suddenly reappeared before us, trim
and miraculous in her famous écru silk and her
famous brown skirt, with the Englishman of the
pockets. Behind them marched the curly-haired
Apollo in the sheet, respectfully bearing Zephine’s
straw suit-case. It was really too much.</p>

<p>“Well Zephine,” I was just able to remark, well-nigh
overcome by my superhuman attempts to ward
off another attack of hysteria, “this is a scene to your
taste. Here is an orchard and here are models—more
or less as you like them. I think we would make
you a stupendous success in the next Academy!”</p>

<p>Zephine, taking in the situation at a glance, wasted
no time in unprofitable speech. She made a sign to
the Englishman of the pockets, who for a wonder
understood it. At least he forthwith presented to
our little company his atlas façade. She made another
sign to the gentleman in the sheet, who put
down her suit-case, pulled his uncombed yellow fore-lock,
and stalked away. She then, under the admiring
eyes of her travelling companions and of Their
Serene Highnesses of Hohenkugel, proceeded to open
the suit-case, revealing her palette, her little folding
easel, and the rest of her painting paraphernalia.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” I burst out. “Are you going to do
it? Or are you going to paint clothes on us?” And
at the same instant Nick demanded: “Who’s your
friend?”</p>

<p>Zephine evidently considered the latter question
more worthy of a reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“He’s the stable boy of the hotel,” she said, “and
he’s been helping me telephone. I’ve engaged rooms
for us all in Bergen. And the captain of the steamer
says we can go on board any time we like. They’re
making coffee for us there. Keep your clothes, for
I’ve saved mine and can lend some to this lady.”
As a matter of fact, there they were, under her painting
kit! “But first turn your backs and hold this
behind you, so that we can have a dressing room.”
And she handed us a green silk petticoat.</p>

<p>It is not for me to record what took place behind
that petticoat. I can only testify that it was upon
a much more serene Highness we were at last permitted
to turn—attired in Zephine’s shiny grey skirt
of super-state, with other necessary adjuncts, and
abounding in the most complicated expressions of
gratitude.</p>

<p>“<i>Kolossal!</i>” let out the Prince. “But I—!” he
added mournfully, beating his brilliant breast.</p>

<p>“You can wrap this around your shoulders,” said
Zephine comfortingly, presenting him with the
green silk petticoat. “And you might give him something,
Herb,” she added. “You seem to have more
than you need.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” archly exclaimed Her Serene Highness.
“Then he is the one! I asked myself which of these
gentlemen was the gracious lady’s husband.”</p>

<p>The violence of my efforts to maintain a decorum
suitable to the occasion must have made me turn a
colour not far from that of the princely pyjamas. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
hardly dared meet the eyes of my accomplices. Yet
when I did so it was to discover in Zephine not quite
the amused self-possession I expected.</p>

<p>As for Nick, he stared a little, he drew himself up
in his Persian dressing gown, he did his best to click
a pair of bare heels, he made Their Serene Highnesses
of Waldeck-Hohenkugel such a bow as they knew
how to appreciate, and he said:</p>

<p>“Pardon, Highness, but you are mistaken.” Then
he turned, somewhat less ceremoniously, to me.
“Look here,” he threw out, in a way that made me
stare in turn. “I don’t know how much the mantua-makers
of Bergen are up to, but Zephine’ll have to
get some new clothes, like the rest of us. She’s given
away most of her own. And I think it’s about time
she tried a new system. Anyhow, the first thing
she’s going to have is one non-reversible garment of
white bombazine, garnished with mosquito netting
and whatever in the flora of the country may answer
to orange blossoms. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>I signified, not without a grin of surprise, that I
got him.</p>

<p>“I suppose you imagine that I owe you something,”
proceeded Nick, “and so I won’t ask you to
listen to any remarks on the subject of a habit you
have latterly developed of snickering at inopportune
moments. I will ask you, though, if you don’t mind,
to go to Trondhjem and look up those enamels. I’m
afraid Bode may be after them. In the meantime
I think Zephine and I will beat it to the North Cape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
I shouldn’t wonder if we ran around to Archangel
and Nova Zembla too. I’m going to telegraph to
England for a yacht. So you can take your time.
But you must be ready for us to pick you up on our
way back.”</p>

<p>At first, you know, I thought they had cooked the
thing up between them. But Nick’s air—rather of a
horse with the bit in his teeth—and Zephine’s unmistakable
pinkness, and a queer look they at last exchanged,
when Nick finished his speech and offered
Zephine his arm, told me that not until that moment,
when two Serene Highnesses, a baroque Englishman,
and I, were staring at them, had those
extraordinary young persons come to the point of
undertaking the delicate negotiations vulgarly known
as getting engaged. Zephine, at any rate, did not
refuse Nick’s offered arm. And with a somewhat
less magnificent bow they strolled away, leaving
me to deal with the situation as best I might.</p>

<p>I did take my time. I bagged the enamels, and
then I went on a two months’ walking tour with the
Englishman of the pockets.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Martin leaned across the dusty parapet,
ridden by that singular depression which one
may know in strange cities. The fervour
of the August sun, giving an intolerable vividness of
outline and detail to the curving perspective, did not
serve to cozen his mood. The ragged gully of the
Arno, sunken between the ordered stone embankments,
the wider curve of parallel façades with their
indefinable touch of dignity and age, the dainty miniature
of Santa Maria della Spina, the crenelated pile
of the old citadel behind the <i>Ponte a Mare</i>, gave him
the sense of something known and wearied of long
ago. He looked down as from an infinite height upon
a group of boys shouting below. They were splashing
in a shallow pool or chasing each other naked on
the sands, with an abandon enviable alike for its disregard
of nature and of man. Beyond, where a
rivulet of the shrunken stream made some pretence
of motion, a row of women knelt above their wash-boards.
They beat their hapless linen with a vehemence
which at such a temperature would have been
preternatural had their chatter not made it miraculous.
The theatrical vivacity of the people, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
unaccustomed faces, their foreign speech, weighed
again on Martin’s humour. He rose impatiently and
turned his back to the river.</p>

<p>The quay was hardly more engaging in the pitiless
morning glare. White pavement and stucco façades
danced together in the quivering silence. Scarcely
a living creature was visible. A man passed with a
panier-laden donkey, uttering a harsh unintelligible
cry. The straw hat on the beast’s head, through
which two long ears protruded comically, provided
a fleeting object of interest. In the distance a woman
approached. She was dressed in white, and Martin
felt a personal resentment against her for not affording
some contrast to the intolerable monotony of
light. Had she come forth in sky-blue or bottle-green,
she would have been a public benefactress,
worthy the freedom of the city.</p>

<p>Wondering miserably what he should do with himself,
Martin cast an indifferent glance at the building
in front of him. It was one of the high dark-browed
Tuscan <i>palazzi</i>, broad-eaved and strong-barred like
the great houses of Florence. The entrance was open,
giving a glimpse of a shady courtyard within. Above
the massive archway was a device that attracted
the young man’s attention. A fragment of chain
hung there, from a bolt projecting above the keystone;
and between the chain and a high stone
escutcheon ran the legend, in letters of tarnished
brass let into the weathered marble:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>ALLA GIORNATA</i><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Martin’s interest was caught. The three links of
chain, the heraldic lion, the enigmatic inscription—what
did they signify? He studied the open gate,
the marble benches beside it, the forbidding windows,
the iron torch-sconces, as if for a clue. As he did so
the sound of steps intruded lightly upon his survey.
Glancing about he remarked the offensive person in
white. He noted, furthermore, that her offence extended
to and included her shoes, but not her hair—which
was dark; that she twirled a white parasol over
her shoulder in the most obvious and irritating satisfaction;
and that her eyes were upon him, with an
expression which closely resembled amusement. At
his look she turned them to the palace gate.</p>

<p>A moment later his resumed inspection of the
writing in the stone was interrupted by the transit
of the parasol. Something of the butterfly assurance
with which that cloud of lace and chiffon blotted out
the dusty inscription prompted Martin to wonder
whether it had a secret which was denied himself.
From a sudden whimsical impulse he demanded
aloud:</p>

<p>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>To his intense astonishment and no small dismay
the parasol slowly turned, revealing a pair of eyes
which no longer dissembled amusement. Yet it was
not the parasol nor the eyes, but the owner of them
who answered:</p>

<p>“It means everything. It means the whole of
life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Then the parasol resumed its rotatory orbit up the
<i>Lungarno Regio</i>.</p>

<p>Martin stared after it, not knowing whether to be
more astounded at his own temerity or at the sound
of his native tongue. But everything in him cried
out against the solitude of that sun-smitten quay;
and he called, desperately:</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I wish you would be a little more
explicit—considering that I have been after that
formula a good many years, and don’t happen to
have my phrase-book about me.”</p>

<p>The parasol hesitated, came gradually to a stand-still,
and once more performed an axial revolution of
forty-five degrees. This time—had Martin not been
too eager to perceive it—the amusement in the eyes
was mingled with curiosity:</p>

<p>“They don’t put it in phrase-books. People have
to translate it for themselves.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know Italian!” protested Martin,
hastily, taking off his hat: “<i>Giornata</i>—Is it like
<i>journée</i>? The day? That which happens between
dark and dark?”</p>

<p>The lady still faced the river, looking back at him
over her shoulder:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the chain!” pursued Martin: “Is it a whole
chain or a broken one?”</p>

<p>“That depends!”</p>

<p>“‘To the day’—and a chain! Why is that the
whole of life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“Why is it not the whole of life?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s only a part. And it’s not the best
part: the part that gets things done, the part that
one likes to remember.”</p>

<p>The parasol eddied lightly in the scorching sun:</p>

<p>“You have been reading phrase-books too much.
That is exactly what it is: the best part, the part
that gets things done—if things ever are done—the
only part that one likes to remember. The rest is
merely padding.”</p>

<p>“But that chops things up so!” objected Martin,
polemically: “And it makes too much of the chain.”</p>

<p>“O! I beg your pardon,” responded the lady
bowing slightly: “I thought it was information you
wanted.” She turned a little toward the <i>Ponte di
Mezzo</i>.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right,” admitted Martin precipitately,
“in a way. But would you really have
people live just for the day?” As he stood there
with his back against the baking stone of the parapet,
his head uncovered to the sun, he became aware that
the point of his interest had somehow shifted from
the writing above the gate to its interpreter with the
parasol. She was not so young, he observed, but
neither—on the other hand—was she so old. He
felt that he would gladly suffer a sunstroke if he could
succeed in prolonging the interpretation.</p>

<p>The lady laughed outright:</p>

<p>“They do! I’m not responsible for it! But what
have you against me? An inoffensive person walks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
down the street, at peace with all the world, when
she is suddenly waylaid by a defiant young man
whom she has never seen and is forced into the heat
of argument—as if the sun were not bad enough
already!”</p>

<p>Martin laughed too, albeit not so lightly, for he
perceived that the interpretation was at an end:</p>

<p>“I beg pardon for waylaying you. I can only
offer you my word that it is not my habit to go about
distressing and destroying all ladies, like Sir Breuse
Saunce Pitie. I suppose I fancied myself the sole
person cognizant of the English language in this
town, which I have never seen and which I already
hate.”</p>

<p>To his relief the lady did not take instant departure,
but laughed again:</p>

<p>“If it comes to apologies we shall be quits. I can
only beg you to believe that it is not my habit to
stop and chaffer with strange gentlemen. I suppose
it was the novelty of your attack that undid me. If
you had begun with so harmless a remark as ‘Good
morning’ I would have known you at once for an
objectionable character; but since you immediately
engaged me in the ultimate problems of existence
you surprised me out of my conventions!”</p>

<p>“I will offer you any reparation in my power—even
to the point of a card!” eagerly rejoined Martin,
who detected signs of unrest in the parasol.</p>

<p>“I will not exact that proof of you,” said the lady:
“Names are necessary in complex societies only—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
three or more.” Although she said it lightly, she
said it in a way that made Martin put back his card-case
and hastily button his coat. “But you mustn’t
hate Pisa,” she went on: “There are charming river
curves in it, and narrow streets with overhanging
eaves. And, if you don’t mind my mentioning things
which are so ordinary as to be starred by Baedeker,
I know a cloister in a quiet corner of the city wall
where the Middle Ages are buried. Or I could even
show you the kingdoms of the world and the glory
of them from the top of a tower.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” burst out Martin, before he
knew what he was about. The next instant, remembering
the card-case, he damned himself.</p>

<p>But after looking across her shoulder at him for a
moment she gave her parasol a jerk of decision.</p>

<p>“I will!” she smiled, facing him at last: “Now
that I have hopelessly compromised myself it is too
late to assume a forgotten dignity and sweep away
with an outraged stare! Why should I not practise
what I preach? <i>Alla giornata!</i> I was just wondering
what to do with this long hot morning. And do put
your hat on. I am already smouldering, even under
my parasol.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>They crossed the quay to a dark little alley that
skirted the flank of his palace, and Martin could
scarcely realise how it was that his mood had so
completely changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Be warned in time!” he said: “It is not too late
to repent. I don’t want to lure you away under false
pretences. I’m just a common tripper and I have a
Baedeker in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“I knew it!” she rejoined: “That is why I am
throwing my reputation to the winds. And I hope
you notice, in the meantime, that we are entering the
Way of Wisdom. See?” she pointed to the name of
the street—<i>Via della Sapienza</i>—cut in a high stone.
“But I always wanted to know what trippers did.
Do tell me!” She put down her parasol as they entered
the cool of the shadow. Martin was glad, for
it enabled him to see her better.</p>

<p>“Must I be butchered to make a Pisan holiday?”
he asked. “Know then that I, who now tread the
Way of Wisdom, started out on a poetical pilgrimage.
I have been walking—figuratively, and a trifle anachronously—in
the footsteps of Shelley. Rome knows
me; also Venice, Ravenna, and the Euganean Hills.
I have been to Spezia. I have pensively treadled
bicycles up and down behind every villa at San
Terenzo, wondering which was the one. I have
sailed boats on the Seno di Lerici. I have gone
swimming at Viareggio. I have haunted the
harbour of Leghorn. And early this morning I
wheeled up here. I am now prepared to make a
brief but comprehensive survey of the city and environs—particularly
of the <i>pineta</i> at Bocca d’Arno.
There I shall compose a sonnet, sitting with my
back against a sea-viewing pine, and then I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
go home. The anatomy of tripping is laid bare
before you!”</p>

<p>The lady laughed.</p>

<p>“I wish I could boast as good a reason for being
here! It is the dentist that brings me.” Martin
noticed that she did not say from where. “But I
am afraid I have thrown away my reputation for
nothing. You have not yet explained the hordes
that pour through this country with their red
books in their hands, as regular as the birds in their
seasons. Why do they do it, do you suppose? They
make no poetical pilgrimages. Have they no lives
of their own to live?”</p>

<p>“You are rather hard on us!” laughed Martin.
They turned out of their alley, a mere crack between
the houses with a strip of blue hung high above, into
a cross street that led to a small square. “It is very
simple. No American woman is quite happy until
she has a motor car and has been to Europe. And
then there is Culture, with a large C, which is making
terrific inroads among us. And there is—‘<i>Kennst Du
das Land</i>’—You know? Not many of us are so lucky
as to stay, like you in the different colonies.” He
looked at her to see how his guess would catch.</p>

<p>“I remember I had ideas about them once,” she
said, in a tone that made Martin wonder. “But I
know them too well now.”</p>

<p>“What about them?”</p>

<p>“They have most of the characteristics of Botany
Bay at its flourishing period. There are a few workers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and loafers; but most of us are hiders, sitting more
or less modestly under smaller or larger clouds!
Don’t ask me which I am!” she laughed, as Martin
looked at her. “I used to think that disreputable
people would be more interesting than reputable
ones,” she went on, “because they had at least the
courage of their convictions. But I have discovered
to my sorrow that they can be just as dull as anybody.
Of course there are glittering exceptions.
But I have even met people of the most unquestionable
virtue who were really worth knowing! I have
come to the sad conclusion that existing classifications
do not classify.”</p>

<p>Martin laughed with her as they went up the
wider street into which their crossway had led them.
But the interest which her very first word had
aroused grew stronger in him than amusement. This
dainty white person whom he had never seen before
to-day—who was she? Where had she been, what
had she done, yesterday, all the other days that
went before their chance meeting by the Arno?
There was something in the lightness of her words,
in the simplicity with which she had accompanied
him, that was not of common days.</p>

<p>The street opened out in front of them into a space
of sun that widened as they advanced, disclosing the
famous <i>piazza</i> with its group of white buildings under
the city wall.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it nice?” she asked. “They always remind
me of a little convoy of ships becalmed—these lonely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
white things with their broad shadows in the sunlight.
But don’t look at that tower. I detest it for
having tried in such a stupid way to be different
from all the towers in the world. Nothing is nice
about it but the view from the top. Which it is too
hot to get at now. Let’s go over to the Campo Santo
and look at the shadows of the tracery on the pavement.
It is always cool and quaint there.”</p>

<p>She raised her parasol and led obliquely across the
great square, between the cathedral and the baptistery,
to a canopied door in a low wall. Martin
stared curiously about him as they went. The burnt
grass between the hot flagstones gave a strange impression
of the solitude of the place, of its evident
separation from the life of the city, which contrasted
singularly with the splendours setting it apart among
the shrines of the world. They rang at the canopied
door and were admitted. It was like stepping into
another century—so calm, so cool, so of itself was
that burial place of another age. Of a different
quality was the very sunshine which gilded the green
of the quadrangle and retraced on the pavement of
the cloister the outlines of the marble lace-work
between the pillars. Martin was without words as
they slowly made the round of the ambulatory, following
and smiling together over the delightful
frescoes. It all seemed to him a piece of the magic
of this woman who had so unexpectedly released him
from the intolerable mood of the morning.</p>

<p>Suddenly, among the sarcophagi, fragments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
sculpture, and commemorative marbles which strew
that painted cloister, a tablet caught his eye. It
was in old French, with a flavour of Italian, and
together they picked out the quaint lettering:</p>

<p>For a moment they were silent. In the stillness
of that sequestered place the forgotten story seemed
to live again. Then Martin put his finger to the
stone:</p>

<p>“See!” he exclaimed. “It was the twenty-first
of August. And to-day is the twenty-first!”</p>

<p>His companion turned her eyes to his, with a
curious smile.</p>

<p>“And I came to show you! If I had any qualms
about <i>les convenances</i> I have none now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>They were silent again, looking at each other and
at the white tablet. There was something in the
little coincidence which seemed to Martin strangely
significant.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Lequel Achille voulut faire le voyage d’Italie.</i>’ How
near it makes him seem, poor boy! I did not think
of there being trippers then,” he said with a smile.
“There was no Shelley; not even a Goethe and a
Mignon—two hundred and thirty-three years ago!”</p>

<p>She made no reply at first. Then she said, softly:</p>

<p>“I wonder how it was with Dame Claude. There
were other things that lacked then, beside your poets.
It must have taken time for the Abbé Gaetani’s letter
to get to Paris.”</p>

<p>“However it was then, it happily makes no difference
now,” returned Martin. A rising elation
filled him—out of the utter unexpectedness of this
meeting, out of its picturesqueness, out of the
infinity of possibilities which it might promise. He
was accordingly amazed at the vehemence with
which his companion turned upon him.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” she exclaimed. “You
who brought me here, and on this day! Have you
forgotten the gateway by the river? Now is not the
time. The time was when the horseman clattered
up the cobble-stones of St. André and into the courtyard
of the Hôtel de Chevigny; when Dame Claude
seized the packet from the page at the door and ran
with it to the <i>secretaire du roi</i>; when he broke the
seal, read the first lines of the Abbé Gaetani, went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
white to the lips, looked at Dame Claude, and turned
away. It was then that it made a difference. It
was then that nothing else made a difference. Things
come, and then other things come. Time is only a
chain to hold us to them—or away from them. It
is mere chance whether it breaks all at once or by
degrees....”</p>

<p>Martin watched her keenly as she spoke, white in
the shadow of the cloister, her hair dark against the
wan frescoes. There was a curious contrast between
the vivid modern figure and those faded images of a
life so dim and far away. And recalling the palace
gate he wondered what there might be of consistency
or inconsistency between what she said so lightly
then and what she said so intensely now. And why?
Where had she been, what had she done, yesterday,
all the other days that went before their chance meeting
by the Arno?</p>

<p>She stopped, as if reading in his eyes. She touched
the white stone softly.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, poor Achille,” she said—“you and
your twenty-six years.”</p>

<p>She did not speak again as they passed on. But
at one of the openings into the green quadrangle a
sudden impulse seized her. She stepped down into
the grass and picked some crimson-tipped daisies
growing there. Then she went back and laid them
on top of the tablet, adding:</p>

<p>“That is for Dame Claude, who was not here all
those years ago to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>They sat where they could follow the shining river
coils that wound down out of the hills, dived under
the red of the city roofs, and wound on again into
the iridescent plain. Through the haze of the Maremma
the glint of the sea at last began to burn, and
out of the north issued ghostly the apparition of the
Carrara mountains. The day had somehow flamed
away, there in that leaning gallery in the corner of
the city wall, where the storied marbles stood alone
with their shadows—a little fleet of ships becalmed
in a quiet haven of the world.</p>

<p>“I am like the wicked in Scripture,” she said. “I
love groves and high places.”</p>

<p>“I would say rather that you were like the Empress
Elisabeth,” rejoined Martin. It seemed to
him that they had always been there, that they
would always remain there—he and this woman
whose very name he did not know.</p>

<p>“Why am I like the Empress Elisabeth?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you read Christomanos?”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Your ignorance is the first gratification my vanity
has had to-day!” laughed Martin. “Christomanos
is the hero of a modern fairy story—which is
all the prettier for being true. It is a kind of
inverted ‘Cinderella.’ He was a little Greek student
in the university of Vienna, who lived in a garret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
in an alley. You know the kind? With stair gables,
and bread shops, and clothes lines? Imagine
a Greek there! And one day a court carriage
rumbled up, just as if it had suddenly rolled out
of a pumpkin, and carried him off to talk Greek to
the empress. The carriage came every morning after
that; and he would spend the day in the imperial
park at Lainz, and go back at night to his stair gable.
And at last he went to live in the palace altogether,
and talked to the empress while she had her hair
combed, and walked leagues with her, and went to
Schönbrunn and Miramar and Corfu. Of course the
ladies-in-waiting were scandalised, but she was used
to that—and he was something of a poet.”</p>

<p>“And after she died he wrote a book about it.
Which shows how true a poet he was!”</p>

<p>“Wait till you read him. The thing was that
people said such things about her, and he knew better;
and it hurt him. Of course he couldn’t help
seeing the picturesqueness of it all, but he isn’t
nasty about it. Most of it is what she said about
things.”</p>

<p>“What did she say about things?”</p>

<p>Martin watched the profile beside him, out-lined
against the marble of the tower and touched faintly
by the glow of the westering sun.</p>

<p>“Well, one thing was a good deal like what you
just told me about high places. Christomanos says
that she always liked hills because there are so
few untrampled places in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“It was rather imperial of her to want to trample
them herself, then. And your Christomanos sounds
as if he lacked humour.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he did,” uttered Martin.</p>

<p>Something in his tone made his companion look at
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be teased,” she said. “Tell me more about
them. How did it end? Did he run away, or did she
send him away, or what?”</p>

<p>“O dear, no! The day of his going was set before
he came.”</p>

<p>“O! I begin to approve of your empress.” She
was silent a moment, looking out toward the sea.
“How was it, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“Why, she was ages older and wiser and everything
else. It was only that she was terribly lonely
and bored, and he could do things that she couldn’t
ask of a maid of honour, and was likewise <i>incliné à
comprendre</i>.”</p>

<p>“O! And what about him?”</p>

<p>“He was so dazed that I don’t suppose you can
tell anything about him. He must have been dazed
all the time—by the enormousness of the distance
between them, by her tragic history, by her personality,
her eyes, her hair, everything about her. And
to drop out of it all—to go back to being a simple
Greek student, and live in a stair gable, and be despised
by bakers and washerwomen when he had been
the familiar friend of their empress, must have been
hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Well, he had his moment,” she mused. “Did
anyone ever have more?”</p>

<p>“Likewise,” chanted Martin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘<i>Après le plaisir vient la peine;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Après la peine, le bonheur!</i>’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“But it’s a high price,” she commented, simply.</p>

<p>“It’s worth it,” asserted Martin.</p>

<p>“You have not sat enough upon towers!” She
looked at him a moment, with a half smile, and then
across the plain again. “No; it’s not because this
place is untrampled that I like to come here. But
you can see over everybody’s walls. You get some
kind of proportion. And I like to think of all the
people—under these roofs, in that haze. Common
life is what pleases me, and common people—simple
people. Our ideas for ourselves are so single. They
shut out so much that might be, and they hardly
ever come out right. Our lives are generally made
up of two or three real days, with years of waiting
and remembering between. Common lives and common
things are better, just as they happen, from
day to day.”</p>

<p>Martin studied her, half wondering what lay behind
her words and half taken by the charm of her
slow inflection. She turned under his eyes; and he
asked at random:</p>

<p>“Do you come here often, for the tower?”</p>

<p>“Not very. I have one of my own, near Naples,
where I have sat much and seen many things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“Think of having a tower near Naples! And I
have to sail in a month!”</p>

<p>“Would you like to exchange?” she asked, smiling.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I!”</p>

<p>“Very well, we will!” she said, playfully. “I will
throw in a view of the city and the bay, with a bit
of Pozzuoli, and a big garden, and all the statues you
can talk to, and an olive orchard that runs down hill
to the sea, and a frog pond....”</p>

<p>“There are worse things!” interrupted Martin.</p>

<p>“What?” she demanded, eyeing him curiously.</p>

<p>“New England!” he exclaimed, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will think so,” she rejoined gravely,
“until you have sat by yourself in a tower and
listened to frogs in a pond. For that matter, though,
the frogs are what I like best.” She looked out again
across the Maremma. The sea began to widen in
the sunset, toward which the Arno ran in links of
brightening fire. “No,” she said at last. “It is not
for us.”</p>

<p>“What?” he asked.</p>

<p>“This!” she answered, waving her hand against
the golden space before them. “We are of the North.
We belong to mist and pallor and dreams. Here they
have no dream. What is there left for them to
dream about? They live. But we don’t know how
to live. We are always waiting—or remembering.”</p>

<p>“As a background, however, I would prefer Campania
to Vermont!”</p>

<p>“No, it is not for us,” she repeated. “Our roots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
are not here: how can we grow? But it is curious
how it catches us all, and how it is typical of desire
fulfilled. What does one ever really attain, really
possess? Things are too great or too unresponsive,
and always too mysterious. Even a little gem that
you can hold in your hand and never let escape: how
much is it yours—that strange indifferent fire? There
is no possession. Instead of getting something else we
lose something of ourselves. After all, people like
Achille down there are happiest, who live their
moment so intensely that they lose themselves all at
once instead of by slow shreds and patches. The
moment is everything. After that——” She put
her hand to her cheek with a motion of weariness.
Then she suddenly looked at Martin and laughed.
“Do you see that sun? I presume the police have
already been notified of my disappearance! I must
beg your pardon for having given you such a day of
it, and ask you to take me down.”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and Martin followed, reluctantly.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall wake up,” he said, as they descended
the winding steps, “and find that you were
a dream. When I feel as I do, that I have known you
all my life, and then reflect that twelve hours ago I
had never set eyes on you—that even now I know no
more about you than that you have a tower in Posilipo—I
am inclined to doubt the so-called realities of
existence.”</p>

<p>Again she laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Why? The actual matter of prolonged passions
has occupied less time! I don’t see what more I
could possibly tell you. The rest would be merely
frills. But people waste so much time in these things.
Don’t you think so? They miss so many chances,
waiting for each other to begin and manœuvring each
other to the proper point. That is why I came with
you this morning—because you lost no time. Think
how different it would have been if you had not waylaid
me so unpardonably!”</p>

<p>Martin did think so. The consciousness of it suddenly
overwhelmed him as they came out into the
deserted square and crossed to the <i>Via Santa Maria</i>.
He would not even have looked back, but for his
companion.</p>

<p>“See!” she cried.</p>

<p>The dome of the baptistery, the roof of the cathedral,
the top of the tower where they had been, were
alight with a delicate rose glow which contrasted
extraordinarily with the cold white of the lower
shadow. The spectacle was to Martin symbolic and
revealing. He saw as if apart from himself the romance
of his day. Could it really have been he to
whom this adventure had fallen? He glanced furtively
at his companion. Was she the intimate
stranger with whom he had been? It pleased him
that he had known herself before knowing things
about her. There would be so much more significance
in making last the steps of acquaintance which
usually come first. But she looked weary, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
thousand uncertainties, a thousand concerns, assailed
him. He could not find courage to say the
things which rose to his lips. His thoughts, however,
wove themselves into a tissue of dreams.</p>

<p>So they went silently down the crooked street
which at last left them on the <i>Lungarno Regio</i>.
Martin hardly knew where he was. Through the
gateway between the houses where the Arno wound
out to the plain the splendour of sunset streamed
into the city, touching the dusty façades with a
fairy glamour, filling the sandy river bed with undreamed
secrets of colour, transmuting the parcelled
water into purple and gold. The quay where Martin
had that morning discovered two persons was
crowded with carriages and pedestrians enjoying the
cool of the day. The theatrical vivacity of the
people, their unaccustomed faces, their foreign speech,
gave a new poignancy to his mood of exaltation.</p>

<p>One of the carriages in the slow progress caused
some confusion by driving out of line. Martin noticed
the handsome horses, the correct footman, the
old lady with a black parasol. She eyed him narrowly
as the landau drove up to the curb. He called the
attention of his companion, who was looking toward
the river.</p>

<p>She turned.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, with a bow and a smile to
the lady in the carriage, “I am afraid I must go.”
He looked blankly into her eyes as she hesitated a
moment. “It was a nice day! It was so long since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
I had seen anybody. And the cloister—that was
nice. I shall always think of you there. It would
have been so different if we had not been ready!
Good-bye, Achille.”</p>

<p>The footman held open the emblazoned door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye—Elisabeth!” said Martin, too dazed
to think or utter more.</p>

<p>The door clicked, the footman leaped to his box,
the coachman flicked the horses. Beside the black
parasol a white one went up, hiding the figure behind
it. Martin’s first impulse was to follow, to see where
the carriage went. He began to walk hastily in the
direction it had taken, watching the two parasols.
Then he stopped and turned resolutely away. “<i>Lequel
Achille voûlut faire le voyage d’Italie</i>,” he said to
himself. “<i>Priez pour le salut de son âme.</i>”</p>

<p>Wondering miserably what he should do with himself,
Martin cast an indifferent glance at the building
in front of him. It was one of the high dark-browed
Tuscan <i>palazzi</i>, broad-eaved and strong-barred like
the great houses of Florence. The entrance was
closed. Above the massive archway was a device
that attracted the young man’s attention. A fragment
of chain hung there, from a bolt projecting
above the keystone; and between the chain and a
high stone escutcheon ran the legend, in letters of
tarnished brass let into the weathered marble:</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>“Mrs. Hopp, ma’am,” announced the maid
from the door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hopp?” repeated Mrs. Derwall
slowly. “Very well. You may show her up here.”
And when no maid was there to answer: “I wonder
what Julie Hopp wants now. People are so funny.
The ones you like are as scarce as auks’ eggs, while
the ones who——”</p>

<p>But at that moment Mrs. Hopp somewhat prematurely
appeared. Mrs. Derwall rose to meet her
with outstretched hands:</p>

<p>“My dear, what grandeur! You must be out for
a campaign.”</p>

<p>“I am, Sophie dear,” responded the caller with an
effusive embrace. “And I want you to join it. Hurry
up and put your hat on.”</p>

<p>“If that were all I had to put on! And here you
have been prinking since five o’clock in the morning.
What in the world are you up to now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Mrs. Hopp, “I’m going in to town
on the ten-twenty, to begin with. And then I’m
going to lunch somewhere. And after that I’m going
shopping——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall began to shake her head.</p>

<p>“No use to come here, Julie. It’s too soon after
Christmas. And I’m on my June allowance now. I
sha’n’t be able to stir out of the house this year—except
when Lou happens to feel a little kindly disposed.”</p>

<p>The melancholy tone of this declaration caused
Mrs. Hopp to smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll trust Lou!”</p>

<p>“If he would trust me it would be more to the
point,” sighed his wife.</p>

<p>“But it would be most so,” pursued her caller,
“if you’d only let me finish what I want to say.
I’ve got a treat for you.”</p>

<p>“O!” exclaimed Mrs. Derwall. “A s’prise?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Guess what it is.”</p>

<p>“A matinée?”</p>

<p>“Something like it, only nicer. Not that everybody
would think so; but people who know would.
You will.” And Mrs. Hopp beamed upon her friend
with an expression in which the freemasonry of the
truly superior outdid the archness of her who would
incite to curiosity.</p>

<p>As it happened, this was an implication which
never had a propitious effect upon Mrs. Derwall.</p>

<p>“Julie, you are so mystifying,” she plaintively
said. But she evinced so small a disposition to penetrate
the mystery that her friend was compelled to
resume her tactics.</p>

<p>“It’s not just one of those silly plays, with a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
boy to play it,” she uttered solemnly. “It’s really
literary, Sophie.”</p>

<p>“O my!” cried Mrs. Derwall with mediocre enthusiasm.
“What have I done, Julie, to deserve
this?”</p>

<p>“You don’t look as if you believed me, Sophie,”
protested Mrs. Hopp. “But just wait. It’s Professor
Murch’s first lecture—Professor Richard Murch,
you know. He’s going to give a course on Browning
and the Higher Life.”</p>

<p>“O, is he?” The triumph with which Mrs. Hopp
delivered herself of her momentous intelligence was
only equalled by the calm with which her interlocutress
received it. There ensued a brief pause,
during which the two ladies studied each other. Then
Mrs. Derwall suddenly realised that the floor was
still hers.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully sweet of you, Julie. But I don’t
know where you get the idea that I’m liter’y. I’m
not a bit, you know—or poetical, either. And as for
the Higher Life—why, really, Julie, life in the suburbs
is high enough for me. I think you ought to
take somebody who could appreciate it better.
There’s Miss Higginson, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Miss Higginson!” burst out Mrs. Hopp. “I
don’t want Miss Higginson, Sophie. I want you.
And you needn’t tell me you don’t care for such
things. I know you better. You are too modest.
And if you could hear that man—the things he
says——!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall sat up very straight.</p>

<p>“H’m, my dear! No, thank you. I might gulp
down Browning, perhaps. But I can’t swallow
your Perch——”</p>

<p>“Murch, Sophie.”</p>

<p>“Murch, then, on top of him. There I draw the
line.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopp looked a little agitated.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Sophie? Do you—do you,
perhaps, know anything against him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” declared Mrs. Derwall.</p>

<p>“What?” inquired Mrs. Hopp with hesitation.
“Is it anything I should know?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is, my dear! But if you haven’t found
it out yet you never will,” replied Mrs. Derwall with
more emphasis than tact.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mrs. Hopp again. “I wouldn’t
want to be countenancing anything, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” put forth Mrs. Derwall oracularly, “any
man who spends his time talking to women is a fool.
I don’t care what he talks about.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopp stared at her friend with a dumb amazement
in which there was something of expectation
unfulfilled. At last, however, she found words of
protest.</p>

<p>“But, Sophie—aren’t you a woman yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say I am,” admitted Mrs. Derwall,
without hedging. “And I’m heartily ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopp was again lost in stupefaction. And
then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Is it your idea, Sophie,” she inquired a little distantly,
“that we—that Professor Murch’s friends
make fools of themselves over him?”</p>

<p>“Since you ask, Julie love, I am obliged to confess
that you divine my idea precisely.”</p>

<p>“Sophie, you’re horrid!” retorted Mrs. Hopp.
“Men could go if they wanted to, but they’re too
busy—and too many other things. Don’t you sometimes
think, Sophie, that men are a little lacking in
some things? That they are rather—coarse?” But
a light in her companion’s eye warned her back to
relevancy. “Besides, he’s married.”</p>

<p>“All the worse!” briskly commented Mrs. Derwall,
whose sex enabled her to follow the train of
Mrs. Hopp’s thought. “And I can be pretty sure
that you’ve never seen his wife.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly true that I haven’t,” proclaimed
Mrs. Hopp, unabashed. “But it’s a case of ‘unknown
wives of famous men’—don’t you know?
She’s probably nice enough, only the quiet sort you
don’t get acquainted with easily. And perhaps”—Mrs.
Hopp took on an air of high misericord—“not
very congenial. You’d think that if she really cared
for what her husband says she’d be more in evidence
at his lectures.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall let herself go the length of a
laugh.</p>

<p>“As if she didn’t know them by heart! I guess
she’s sorry for the day she first let herself listen to
them. She probably taught Lurch——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Murch, Sophie.”</p>

<p>“Murch, then, what an agreeable sensation it was
to have ladies hang on his lips; and when she got
tired of listening he tried it on the rest of you. Besides,
if she were there it would spoil the whole
show.”</p>

<p>“Sophie, you’re just as nasty as you can be!” cried
Mrs. Hopp. “He needs the money. I know he
does. He looks so ill, too—so pale and thin. It
makes your heart ache to see him. And when he
reads ‘James Lee’s Wife’——”</p>

<p>Words failed her. As for Mrs. Derwall, she gave
vent to a perceptible sniff.</p>

<p>“Of course he looks pale! Anybody can look pale.
You can look pale. I can look pale. How can he
help looking pale if he eats all the luncheons you
stuff him with? And if he looked red and fat do you
suppose anybody would pay him to read love
poems?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopp tossed her head.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you to talk. But you
haven’t seen him, and I have. Besides, you haven’t
been through things. If you knew what the world
really is! If you knew, Sophie Derwall!” Mrs.
Hopp, who was in receipt of comfortable alimony
from a good-natured button manufacturer, darted
upon her friend the meaning glances of one who has
drained life’s goblet to the lees. “No, some people
are fated to make mistakes. And to pay for them,
Sophie. I know Professor Murch is unhappy. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
you could only hear how he talks about Mr. and
Mrs. Browning——!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall was able to contain herself no longer.</p>

<p>“Julie Hopp!” she burst out. “Never speak to
me again of Mr. and Mrs. Browning! Never! never!
never! I can’t stand them. They were the two
most colossal bores and fakes of the nineteenth
century! Posilutely!”</p>

<p>The other lady was at first too horrified for words.
Then dignity and scorn supported her, like caryatides,
on either hand. Which spectacle, it must be
said in passing, restored to Mrs. Derwall her tranquillity.</p>

<p>“Sophie Derwall,” at length demanded the outraged
Mrs. Hopp, “how dare you say such monstrous
things? Do you mean to tell me—you who
pretend to read so much, to care so little for ephemeral
literature—do you mean to tell me that you
care nothing for Browning?” To register her intonation
of the sacred syllables is a feat quite beyond
the resources of unfeeling print.</p>

<p>“Very little, Julie,” responded Mrs. Derwall pleasantly,
“very little. And the fact that ten million
women go into spasms over him makes me care less.
I prefer Lewis Carroll.”</p>

<p>At that moment Providence interposed, in the
person of the maid.</p>

<p>“A gentleman in the reception-room, ma’am. What
shall I——?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopp rose with majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t keep you, Sophie. I must catch my
train. I am sorry you won’t come with me. You
don’t know what you miss. And we may not have
many more opportunities to do things together. I
meant to tell you—if you had given me a chance.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall took it with humility, yet with
amiability.</p>

<p>“You really make me ashamed of myself, Julie,”
she returned. “It was lovely of you to think of me.
I’ll go with you another time—to the Palace or the
Rivoli, perhaps. They are more in my line, you
know. Good-bye, dearie.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>“Is this the lady of the house?” inquired the gentleman
in the reception-room as Mrs. Derwall appeared
upon the threshold.</p>

<p>This question caused her to halt in her progress,
and recalled to her mind the fact that she had responded
to the maid’s announcement with rather
more precipitation than she might under other circumstances
have displayed.</p>

<p>“It is,” she somewhat stiffly replied. “But I regret
to say that she requires no books to-day.”</p>

<p>“O, please wait a minute!” cried the caller as she
started to retire. “I knew I should trip up. I was
so sure you would take me for a book agent that I
hypnotised myself into beginning like one. But I’m
not one. I never was one. I never shall be one. I
abominate books!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>He ended almost violently. And as she listened
Mrs. Derwall could see very well that he was not
what she thought.</p>

<p>“I won’t run away yet, then,” she laughed. “You
are too encouraging. I have just estranged a lifelong
friend by telling her much the same thing, and I was
in danger—well, of caving a little.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Don’t cave when you have as
good ground as that under your feet! What will
you do when you get to a real quicksand? I evidently
appeared on the scene just in time. I shall give you
all the moral support you want. I dare say I can
damn and double-damn books in more kinds of ways
than you ever dreamed. Life is so amusing that I
continually wonder how people can turn their eyes
from it long enough to look at a book.”</p>

<p>“How about the Higher Life?” inquired Mrs.
Derwall demurely.</p>

<p>“What in the world is that?” demanded the caller,
mystified. He looked about the room, much as if he
expected to see its legs sticking out from behind the
curtains.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me!” Mrs. Derwall waved it from her.
“Ask any other woman but me. I don’t know. I
don’t want to know. I’ve just refused to go to town
with my lifelong friend and find out. There’s a
Professor Richard Church, or Birch, or Smirch, or
somebody, who tells people at two dollars a head.
But it’s not too late for you. The eleven-five train
will do you quite nicely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated the caller. “I don’t think I’m
in such a hurry as all that.” He still looked rather
curiously about, however. “But you frighten me.
You frighten me more than I expected. I don’t
know whether I shall dare to tell you what I came
for.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall, who found that things were going
very well, encouraged him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of me. I am quite harmless.
More than that, I am the most helpless of creatures
in the face of a determined appeal. What are you—patent
medicine? Needles? Charity? Gold
mines? I may invest in you yet.”</p>

<p>“But it’s nothing of that kind! It’s just the opposite.
I don’t want to take money out of your
pocket. I want to put it in.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re the man for me!” cried Mrs. Derwall.
“Christmas has gone, and ruin stares me in
the face!”</p>

<p>“You reassure me,” smiled the caller. “But don’t
go too far. Don’t, for instance, imagine me the attorney
of a maiden aunt, come to hand over a handsome
legacy. And don’t read pure altruism in my
countenance. I——” He began to laugh. “Shall I
say it?”</p>

<p>“If it’s respectable,” said Mrs. Derwall. “You
begin to make me ask myself questions.”</p>

<p>“It’s only too respectable, heaven knows! But
it’s a little unexpected. It will take your breath
away. You may scream. You might even faint.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
One never can tell what ladies will do. Are you
temperamental?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall sniffed. There was that in her sniff
however, which intimated that she was not unwilling
to hear what her visitor had to impart.</p>

<p>“I like that! Do I look so much like the Eternal
Feminine? Do your direst and I promise you not to
make a scene.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the caller, “I throw the
responsibility on you. I came in to buy your
house.”</p>

<p>If faces could fall, as literature popularly affirms,
Mrs. Derwall’s would have bumped the floor with
some force. As it was she treated her interlocutor
to a stare in which the surprise he had predicted
mingled with disillusion. She therefore stretched
the truth.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t want to sell my house,” she uttered
briefly.</p>

<p>The stranger did not appear to be in the least disconcerted.</p>

<p>“So far, so good. I’ve found out, at any rate, that
the house is yours to sell. It might have been somebody
else’s. And let me congratulate you on your
self-control.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, it is somebody else’s—namely
my husband’s,” rejoined that gentleman’s consort
with dignity.</p>

<p>“O, well, that is a mere detail which does not
affect the case,” remarked the caller easily. “Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
course the point is whether you would make any
objection to his parting with it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall glanced vaguely about. As a matter
of fact, she and Lou had discussed the matter no
later than last night. But to have the hypothetical
purchaser suddenly materialise made her search her
own mind again. Besides, she felt an indefinable
resentment against her visitor for having turned out
so much less interesting than he seemed to promise.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you want of the place?”
she asked at last.</p>

<p>“Nothing improper, I assure you! I merely want
to live in it.”</p>

<p>“But why? Have you ever been in it before?
Does it hold some romance for you?”</p>

<p>“Romance! Heavens no! What have romance
and I to do with each other? I am a married man.
I just happened to be passing by, and it beckoned
to me. ‘That is the house for me,’ I said, and I
walked straight in.”</p>

<p>“But what do you see in it?” demanded Mrs.
Derwall, casting her eye once more about.</p>

<p>“I see everything you don’t,” responded the caller
quickly. “To say nothing of a very agreeable hostess,
it’s just the right size, it’s just the right colour,
it’s in just the right place. How did you happen
to build it so exactly for me?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Madam, you surprise me. You exhibit every
symptom of a lady who has lived to repent of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
architectural errors. If you bought the house outright,
as I hope to do, I should not expect that you
would even listen to me. As it is, however, I have
hopes of prevailing upon you to let me have it.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say about it,” replied Mrs.
Derwall with an air of finality. “You will have to
see my husband.”</p>

<p>“Of course! And I shall be delighted to do so at
the earliest possible moment. But in the meantime,
in order that I may do so with the more intelligence,
would you mind showing me the premises?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall laughed in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“Gracious! How persistent you are! You are perfectly
welcome to look around. Only mind: I don’t
exhibit as to a prospective buyer; I show as to a visiting
friend. I have no more idea of getting up and
moving out and going all through the torment of
architects and builders and strikes and heaven knows
what, than I have of——”</p>

<p>“Of going to Professor Murch’s lectures,” suggested
the caller with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes. Thank you. I couldn’t think of anything
impossible enough. Will you come this way? This
is the reception-room, you see. There is a library on
the other side of the hall.” And without further ado
she led the way through the rooms.</p>

<p>Having recovered her poise, and perhaps with a
new appreciation of her companion’s qualities, Mrs.
Derwall proceeded to enter into the spirit of the
occasion—as she well knew how. They had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
lively time of it. They went upstairs. They went
downstairs. They explored every cupboard and cubbyhole.
They examined the plumbing. They criticised
the colour schemes. Mrs. Derwall expatiated
on all the disadvantages of the house. Her visitor
seized unerringly upon every advantage. And so at
last they completed in the cellar their round of inspection.</p>

<p>“This is the very nicest part of the house,” sighed
Mrs. Derwall. “It’s so dry and comfortable and
cosy that I often wake up in the night and wish I
were in it!”</p>

<p>The visitor turned solemnly upon her.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he began, “its qualities are such that
I am completely undone. Such a laundry, such
storerooms, such coal-bins, never were on sea or land.
I shall not draw a peaceful breath until they are
mine. Believe me, madam; never, never in this
world. You will do me an irreparable injury if you
refuse to sell me this house. You don’t care two
pins about it. I do. Sell it to me, then. It is small,
but I shall give you sixteen thousand dollars for it.
Now, this minute.” And drawing a cheque-book
from his pocket he uncapped his fountain-pen.
“What name shall I put down?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall was too much surprised by the suddenness
of his onslaught to answer.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a fair price?” inquired her companion.
“If you don’t think so I am sure we shall have no
trouble in coming to terms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” uttered Mrs. Derwall slowly. “But——”</p>

<p>The stranger cut her off.</p>

<p>“Of course I have no idea of trying to force you
to do what you don’t want. So far as that goes, however,
I fancy that you’re pretty well able to take care
of your end of a bargain. But it strikes me as rather
a good deal for you. You can recoup yourself for
Christmas, and then you can go to Palm Beach or
Cairo or Zanzibar or somewhere for the bad part of
the winter, while I am freezing here.”</p>

<p>“Why, when would you want to come in?” asked
Mrs. Derwall.</p>

<p>“Let’s see.” He began calculating on his
fingers. “To-day is Thursday. Friday, Saturday,
Sunday—I want to come in Monday. Next Monday.
That will give me time to get settled before
Wednesday.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall all but shrieked.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear man, have you lost your mind? I
never heard of such a thing in my life. It would take
me from now till then to get ready if I began this
minute. And I have a week-end party on and
couldn’t begin to touch a thing till Tuesday at the
very earliest. I like your blandness!”</p>

<p>He was imperturbable.</p>

<p>“My dear lady, you can do it perfectly well. I
have done it myself a dozen times. All it needs is a
little generalship. You just arrange things beforehand—with
squads of packers and cleaners to follow
each other. You could clear out Windsor Castle in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
a day, that way. Of course I divide the expense with
you. Come, what name shall I write?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall hardly heard him through. She
collapsed upon a soapbox, and she laughed until her
visitor began to scratch his head.</p>

<p>“You ridiculous man!” she gasped, wiping her
eyes. “I declare, you deserve the house! A man
who knows what he wants to that degree! Who in
the world are you, that you suavely propose to me
to move out in a day? It’s like carrying off the
roof from over my head! Go on! You shall have
it in spite of everything. I don’t know what my
husband will do to me, but it’s not often given
one to be sublime. Louis N. Derwall is the name.
L-o-u——”</p>

<p>And off she went again. By the time she came
back the cheque was ready for her. She took it with
a certain eagerness, for she was not without her curiosities.
But after one glance she suddenly sobered.
She eyed the paper some time without saying a word.
Finally, however, she looked up at the signatory,
who stood quizzically watching her.</p>

<p>“Professor Richard Murch?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The same!” responded that personage, with an
elaborate bow.</p>

<p>“The Professor Richard Murch who lectures to
ladies about Browning and the Higher Life?”</p>

<p>“The very one. And if I don’t hurry I shall be
late for the lecture you refused to go to. Will you
come now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>She did not answer at first. She looked him slowly
up and down for as much as a minute. Then she rose,
leisurely crossed the cellar to the furnace, opened the
door, and threw in the cheque. After which she
looked back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“No thank you, professor. And that’s what I
think of you and your cheque. Good morning.”</p>

<p>She turned her back on him again. She took up a
shovel. She made for the coalbin.</p>

<p>At that Mr. Murch, who had hitherto said nothing,
started across the floor.</p>

<p>“Permit me, Mrs. Derwall. You may not care to
sell me so admirable a furnace, but you will, at least,
allow me to stoke it this once.”</p>

<p>The offended matron tossed her head.</p>

<p>“By no means, Mr. Murch. I wouldn’t think of
letting you soil your poetical hands. Remember
your ladies. They pant for you. As for me, I am
quite able to look after my own furnace, thank you.
I am not a disciple of the Higher Life, you know. I
make pies instead of reading poetry. And when it
comes to shovelling coal, I dare say I am rather more
expert than you are.” With which she emptied her
shovel through the furnace door.</p>

<p>“Madam, it pains me to contradict you” remarked
the professor, who had kept a critical eye
upon this manœuvre. “I am only too well aware
that my other offences are gross enough. But Truth
and Honour alike compel me to confess that I can
shovel coal better than that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall’s wrath had hitherto maintained
lofty heights. But she now began to break down.
She betrayed the first signs of a womanly irritation.
She snorted contemptuously. “I’d like to see you!
I bet you can’t.”</p>

<p>The professor held her eye.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I do mean it, Mr. Murch!” rejoined Mrs. Derwall
with some spirit. “What’s more, I’ll stake the
house on it. If you can throw three shovelfuls into
that furnace without dropping one coal or once hitting
the side of the door, I’ll take another cheque
from you.”</p>

<p>The lecturer to ladies smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s a sporting proposition, Mrs. Derwall.
But as evidence that I have no wish to get your house
from you again under false pretences, I will thank
you for your courtesy and wish you a very good
morning.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Mr. Murch!” cried Mrs. Derwall
derisively. “You don’t back out like that. I want
to see how well you acquit yourself. Here’s the
shovel. And if you fulfill the terms it is yours—with
the house.”</p>

<p>He took the shovel which she handed him. He
looked at her a moment, to give her time to retract.
He got out his fountain pen again and started to rewrite
his cheque.</p>

<p>“Seventeen thousand, did we say?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall chuckled on her soap box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t take bribes, Mr. Murch. Why not make
it fifteen? Cheques are cheaper than houses.”</p>

<p>He made it fifteen, and he presented it to Mrs.
Derwall. Then he turned to the furnace. And he
put in two shovels full of coal so quickly and so
neatly that Mrs. Derwall saw her house slipping
from under her feet. But before filling the shovel
the third time Mr. Murch faced her.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said. “Do you happen to know
a Mrs. Hopp?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall stiffened.</p>

<p>“Yes. She was here when you came.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Why did you send her away? I really
came out here, you know, to buy her house. I—I
hear she wants to sell it. Would you advise me to
look at it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall examined her cheque reflectively.</p>

<p>“Do you lecture as well as you shovel coal, Mr.
Murch?”</p>

<p>“Goodness no!” he replied. “I worked my way
around the world, once, as a stoker. But I make
more money out of Browning. I fancy I make more
than he did. Don’t you think, though, that I’d better
take a look at your Mrs. Hopp? As you say,
cheques are cheaper than houses.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall re-examined her cheque.</p>

<p>“She isn’t there. You’re keeping her waiting in
town while you snatch my house from over my head.
She——”</p>

<p>A heavy tread sounded on the cellar stair. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
descended into view a large and florid gentleman
who gazed with some surprise, first at the well-dressed
stranger who stood in front of his furnace,
toying familiarly with his coal shovel, then at Mrs.
Derwall, seated on her soap box as it were in her
boudoir, conversing with the same.</p>

<p>Mrs. Derwall rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>“O Lou!” she cried. “Don’t you think a cheque
in the hand is worth two in the f-ush? We start
for Zanzibar Monday night. I’ve found you a
buyer for the house. Mr. Murch, Mr. Derwall.”</p>

<p>And she handed Lou the cheque.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BATHERS">THE BATHERS</h2>
</div>


<p>The painter laughed as he splashed into the
shallows. A million crabs were idling in the
linked gold of the sun, and they scurried away
or burrowed frantically into the sand at his irruption
among them. He waded on, catching his breath
delightedly at the freshness of the rising water. The
fancy came to him that he was entering a new world
by this downward path: he wondered how the clouds
would look from the bottom of the sea—and the
stars, and the scudding <i>bragozzi</i>. He glanced back
a moment, to the world from which he had fled. The
Alps filled the horizon with pale outlines of shadow.
Between them and the long spit of the Lido were
shining lagoon spaces, out of which the clustered
towers seemed to look wistfully over into the unpent
sea. With the vividness of mirage he recalled a
placid water avenue winding green between its lines
of awninged palaces. Then he turned from it all, in
sudden hatred of his artificial life, of the restlessness
to express. He envied the fisherfolk under their butterfly
sails out there where the Adriatic swept bare
and blue to the east. There were the true creators!
They did not copy those colours to hang on a wall.
They made them—to blow in the open sea, to toss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
unspoiled in the rains of heaven! They did not
watch. They lived.</p>

<p>The painter threw himself forward with a great
splash, opening wide his arms and ducking his head
as if in homage. He laughed as he came up. Blinking
and sputtering, he swam lazily to the full extent
of his limbs in the joy of finding himself in a new
element, rid of the last conventionality of clothes.
The content of it filled him. As he moved over green
abysses, somehow hanging miraculously as he chose,
he seemed to be free from even so dogging a burden
as Gravity. And his whole body—not merely hands
and face—was alive to poignant sensations, to the
freshness and rhythm of the sea.</p>

<p>A long time he drifted in the slow swell, jealous to
take in the tingle of sea and sun and sky through
every pore. And as he idly floated there a shout
suddenly startled him from behind, and a great dash
of water half choked him. Then someone began to
laugh, but stopped short. When at last he could
breathe and see, he found a young man regarding
him out of smiling eyes that tried to look grave.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the newcomer, who
spoke in the slow dialect of the lagoon—so different
from the slippery talk of the Venetians. “I thought
you were my brother. He is of the <i>dazio</i> here at
Alberoni, and I meant to surprise him. I would not
have disturbed you if I had known.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” replied the painter. “There is
room in the sea for both of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The other laughed, regarding the painter curiously.</p>

<p>The painter returned the gaze as frankly. With
the skilled eye of his craft, yet almost as if his fancy
were realised and this were the first met of a new
race, he noted the clear tanned skin, the set of the
neck, the turn of the sinewy arm. He wondered how
they would understand each other, forgetting that
they had already spoken.</p>

<p>“You are not from Chioggia,” said the stranger.
“I know almost everybody there; and then you do
not speak their language. I know the Pellestrina
dialect too, and the Venetian, and the Buranello;
but yours is different from them all. Where is your
country? I am from Malamocco.”</p>

<p>The painter smiled.</p>

<p>“Venice is my country now,” he answered, “but
I speak the Florentine dialect.” Although he had
picked up the speech of the lagoon his foreign accent
always betrayed him.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>Fiorenza</i>!” exclaimed the stranger, using the
beautiful old name which the Florentines themselves
have discarded. “That is on the mainland, isn’t it?
I have been only to places on the lagoon, like Campalto
and La Rana. But I would like to see Florence,
too.... You swim differently there, as well as talk
differently,” he added, watching the painter’s stroke.
“This is the way we swim.” He struck out hand
over hand, throwing his body from one side to the
other with great splashes. He made such headway
that the painter could not keep up with him. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
you swam that way I think you would go faster,” he
suggested politely.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” returned the painter. “I don’t
swim very well.”</p>

<p>“Can you dive?” asked the stranger. “Let’s see
who can bring up something first.” He turned a
somersault and disappeared glimmering into the
green depths, whence presently he shot up waving a
streamer of seaweed. “Didn’t you get anything?”
he asked, noting his companion’s empty hand.</p>

<p>“I didn’t even try,” smiled the painter. “You
swim much better than I.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma!</i>” exclaimed the other. “I have probably
had more practice.” He paused, half embarrassed.
“I think I will swim out a little. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but perhaps not,” replied the painter.
“I have been out a good while. I am going in now.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you forgiven me for drowning you?”
laughed the stranger. “<i>A rivedersi!</i>”</p>

<p>The painter watched till the black head was a mere
dancing speck in the water.</p>

<p>“That was amusing,” he thought. “He wouldn’t
have called me ‘thou’ if I had had my clothes on.
And he is a better man than I....”</p>

<p>Back on the beach the painter abandoned himself
anew to sheer sensation. He did not think. He
scarcely remembered. He simply felt in every nerve
the glow of the sun, the caress of the air, the pulse of
the sea lapping softly at his feet. As he lay there,
happy and languid in the warm sand, the sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
splashing in the shallows came like an intrusion.
But opening his eyes he saw the young man of Malamocco
come up from the water, seemly and sunburned
and glistening in the light. It might have
been a young sea-god rising from the waves. The
painter smiled as he watched the dripping apparition,
so in keeping with his humour. The youth caught
the smile and answered it. He came and threw himself
down in the sand beside the painter. They
looked at one another, the smile still in their eyes.</p>

<p>The painter was glad he had hidden his clothes.
He felt how absurd were those distinctions in the
world from which he came, of nationality, of belief,
of rank. They could be laid aside with one’s coat.
This was another world, with other standards. He
and the young man beside him—by what different
roads had they travelled to this beach! But what
influence in their lives had wrought upon them like
that secret pre-natal influence which on separate
continents, among different races, had cast them in
an identical mould? Here lay the two of them together
by the sea, children both of earth, without
distinction or preference between them—unless that
most ancient preference of earth for the fit.</p>

<p>“How white you are!” exclaimed the stranger.
“I am all black from the sun.” He lifted his arm to
show how the darkness of the lower tan shaded into
tone but a trifle paler. “When we fish in the lagoon
we often go like this. But even on the sea the sun
burns through our clothes. I have always been black.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
I never saw anybody so white as you are—except
perhaps women, and sick people, and the <i>signori</i> at
the Lido.”</p>

<p>Shame filled the painter—shame, and a passionate
envy. He looked admiringly at the young fisherman
stretched out beside him, followed all the lines of the
strong bronzed figure, without a curve of excess in
its supple youth, and without one of deficiency. Then
he glanced at his own lank white limbs. He felt the
cut of being classed with women and sick people and
<i>signori</i>! This was the only shame of nakedness—to
have a body not worth looking at. Instinctively he
took up handfuls of the fine sand and poured it over
himself. The mockery of the life he had fled from
that morning surged back over him. How he hated
the imprisonment of houses, the lure of ambition, the
thirst for pleasure, that had made him what he was!
How he envied this fisherman his life of sun and sea,
and his untroubled youth, and his unspoiled body!</p>

<p>“You take too little at a time,” laughed the fisherman.
He sat up to scoop out great handfuls of sand,
which he threw over the painter’s body until it was
quite buried. Then he heaped a mound over himself,
and looked inquiringly at the painter. “I know
by your skin that you are not of my <i>mestiere</i>. But
people in Venice do many things. What is your
trade?”</p>

<p>The painter felt more comfortable under the sand,
and the unsuspecting “<i>ti</i>” of the dialect touched him
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“My <i>mestiere</i> is to paint,” he said. “I make pictures.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is a nice trade! My cousin is on one of
the Chioggia steamers, and he makes pictures of the
<i>bragozzi</i> when he has taken the tickets. You should
see how beautiful they are. Do you paint <i>bragozzi</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and other things: houses, and gardens, and
sometimes people.”</p>

<p>“It must be very difficult. Did you have someone
to show you how?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the painter gravely. He thought
of New York, and Paris, and the great galleries.</p>

<p>“Ah! That is different. My cousin says faces
are very hard, unless you have a master. But he
does <i>bragozzi</i> well because he knows all about them.
His father builds them. He sold one once for ten
francs. Do you sell yours?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. But I paint a great many more than
I sell.”</p>

<p>“So does my cousin. He gives them to people to
hang in their houses. And in the shops he buys more
cheaply if he gives a <i>bragozzo</i>. Do you do anything
else?”</p>

<p>It was evident that the fisherman’s conception of
the picture market was based on the sale effected
by his relative, and that his deductions regarding the
painter’s income were therefore not dazzling.</p>

<p>The painter was pleased. He had feared lest a
breach separate him and his companion too early in
their relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“No,” he confessed. “I don’t know how to do
anything else.”</p>

<p>The fisherman looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“But who knows?” he pursued encouragingly.
“If you do nothing else perhaps you will come to
paint big pictures with gold frames—like the ones
under the <i>procuratie</i> in the Piazza San Marco. My
cousin says the artists who paint those are <i>signori</i>.
Then it will be a trade! I shall never be a <i>signor</i> at
mine. Do you know how long it takes me to earn
ten francs?”</p>

<p>The painter remembered how often he had seen
fishermen in their long brown stockings and wooden
shoes before the brilliant windows of the Piazza.
Never before had he conceived of them otherwise
than as a picturesque foil to the glitter of civilisation.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “But your <i>mestiere</i> is better
than mine. It keeps you out of doors; and what you
do is necessary to people more than what I do.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma!</i> It is a pleasure to be on the sea in a good
wind. I would not like to be shut up in a shop, or
anything like that. But we make so little. And the
winter! Sometimes we do not even catch enough to
eat. You can make a picture whenever you want,
but I can’t catch a fish whenever I want!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you can eat your fish when you do catch
him, while my picture is no good to me unless I sell
it. I can’t eat it. And it isn’t the kind of thing that
everybody wants to buy, like a fish.”</p>

<p>“That is so. But if people don’t like your picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
you can ask them what they do like, and sit down
and paint it for them. <i>Ecco!</i> And in the winter you
can stay comfortably by the hearth in the kitchen,
and make your pictures of boats and flowers and summer
and what else do I know, while outside it snows.
But I have to go into the sea to get my fish, if I get
shipwrecked for it.”</p>

<p>The painter smiled, still envying the strong brown
body buried in the sand beside him. And then he
suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“Have you ever been shipwrecked?”</p>

<p>“Only once,” answered the fisherman, as if it
were an every-day matter.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” demanded the painter eagerly,
turning on his elbow to eye this person who had been
through shipwrecks and thought nothing of it.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma!</i> I was small then,” began the fisherman
apologetically, as if he would be less awkward now.
“It was in my grandfather’s <i>bragozzo</i>, one night in
March. We were blown on to the Punta dei Sabbioni,
and the boat broke in two.” He stopped as if
there were nothing more to say.</p>

<p>“Well, what happened? How did you get ashore?”</p>

<p>“God knows,” replied the fisherman. “We fell
into the water, and after a while I woke up with men
rubbing me. My grandfather was there, too. My
father and my brother were drowned.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“What was there to do then? We went home.”</p>

<p>The picture of this common little seashore drama<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
flared up in the painter’s imagination. He was impatient
that it should be told him so barely. He
wanted a hundred details, and he could not think
how to bring them out.</p>

<p>“What did your mother do?” he asked, desperate.</p>

<p>“What do women do? She cried.”</p>

<p>“Did they find your father and brother?”</p>

<p>“My father, yes; but not my brother. This makes
one feel sleepy after being in the water, doesn’t it?”
He closed his eyes, turning a little his head from the
sun.</p>

<p>The painter stared. In the life back there among
the sculptured palaces these were things read, things
far away as Olympus and the Crusades—not things
seen. He felt like a child in the presence of one who
has come back scarred from the wars.</p>

<p>Feeling the power of eyes upon him, the fisherman
finally opened his own.</p>

<p>“How warm it is here, eh? It is better than that
time at the Sabbioni. Ee-ee that was cold!” He
drew up his shoulders as if to shiver, and the sand
ran from him in rivulets. “I love the summer. I
wish it would never end. We often come to this same
place to pull in our nets; but it is not always so nice
as this.”</p>

<p>The painter was full of curiosity about a life to
him so romantic.</p>

<p>“Do you come here in a <i>bragozzo</i>?” he asked, with
the respect due to a superior, fearful of offending by
too many questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered the fisherman. “It is too
shallow. We come in a <i>caorlina</i>, about ten of us,
and plant the nets, and afterwards drag them up on
the sand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried the painter. “I have seen it at
Sant’ Elisabetta—three or four men hauling at each
rope, and then the net squirming with fish! And
afterwards they beach the boats, and build fires on
the sand, and have their breakfast.” He had often
sketched the bare-legged men and boys tugging at
the ropes, and had thought how good their fresh fish
and <i>polenta</i> must be in the morning air on the edge
of the sea.</p>

<p>“Yes, we go there often. But the nets are not always
squirming with fish. Sometimes we get nothing
but crabs, cast after cast.”</p>

<p>“Do you anything else besides go in the <i>caorlina</i>?”
asked the painter.</p>

<p>“Hoo-oo!” exclaimed the fisherman in a high singing
interjection, with an amused smile. “I go oftener
in my uncle’s <i>bragozzo</i>. We have none, because ours
was lost when my father was drowned and we have
never been able to get another. They cost more than
the painted ones! We generally leave in the afternoon
and stay out all night, so as to get the fish to
the Rialto early in the morning. That is good—to
lie on the deck after the nets are down, and watch
the stars playing behind the sail, and the light-houses
here and at Cavallino winking their eyes. And then
to run in when the sun comes up all wet and cool out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
of the sea, and the wind begins to blow! But in winter
it is another affair, and when there are storms.
Two or three boats are lost in every <i>Bora</i>.”</p>

<p>The painter’s humility grew, as he inwardly compared
the vicissitudes of studio life with this adventuring
upon the deep.</p>

<p>“But you would rather live on the water than in a
shop, didn’t you say?”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma!</i> Now, yes—when the nights are a <i>delizia</i>
and we have enough to eat. But in winter! Then it
is another story.” He propped himself up on his
elbows and began excavating a reservoir, into which
the water rose slowly. “No, I would not like to
be in a shop. But I would like to be a <i>signor</i>,
and have plenty of money without working, and eat
meat every day, and in the winter always have
a fire in the kitchen, and go as often as I liked
to the inn. And I would like to go to other places,
to see Florence, and all the countries in the world.
That is what I would like the best of all. Sometimes
steamers pass us in the sea at night, with lamps in
all their little round windows, and people singing on
the deck—high over the top of our mast—and it
makes me sad. They pass so quickly, with the water
white behind them, and their lights grow small and
small in the dark, and disappear. Where do they
go, the ships? I want to know, and go with them
to the countries at the end of the sea.” He looked
across the painter toward the breakwater, where
the sails of a pilot boat were bobbing up and down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
and where, far away, the sea ran blue to the sky.
“But I never shall. I have to catch fish for my
family. They would not have enough if I went
away.... A boy I knew went to America, and
now he sends home money to his mother—a
great deal. He won a <i>terno</i> at the lottery, enough to
pay for the steamer and then to keep him till he
found a place. But I am not lucky. And even if I
could go I could not take my wife, and my mother
might have nothing to eat long before I could send
her money. They speak another language there—and
many things. Have you been to America?”
He asked it nonchalantly, tracing arabesques in the
damp sand of his reservoir, much as one might inquire,
“Have you been to the moon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the painter, absently, “I have
been to America.” He lay on his back, his hands
under his head, looking into the sea. The gleam of
its blue was curiously watered by ripples of shadow
sweeping across it in shades from purple to the pallor
of the sky. He wished that all evils were so calculable
as winter; and he was touched by the simplicity
of these ambitions, by the poetry of the lighted ships.
He had not thought of a wife, the fisherman was so
young. After all, had he not everything?</p>

<p>The fisherman turned instantly, forgetting his
arabesques.</p>

<p>“You have been to America?” He sat up, edging
nearer the painter and looking down at him with a
strange and new curiosity. “You have been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
America! Why didn’t you tell me before? What is
it like?”</p>

<p>The painter was sorry. But he looked up at the
eager face bent upon him, and he smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is very much like this. There are fields
and trees, and rivers run into the sea, and there is a
sun every day, and sometimes there is a moon at
night.”</p>

<p>“A sun every day!” broke in the fisherman.
“Sometimes there is none for a month here! I would
like that. Is it like Venice—with <i>palazzi</i>, and gondolas,
and the <i>campanile</i>?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the painter, “it is not like Venice.
There are no gondolas and no <i>campanile</i>; and the
<i>palazzi</i> are all new; and they don’t have four, five,
six floors, but fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“They must be as high as the <i>campanile</i>, then!
And new! In Venice all the houses are so old. I like
new things. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well—not so much,” replied the painter. “It is
hard to tell which of them will last. Old things are
ones that were good enough to last.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the fisherman. “What are the people
like?”</p>

<p>“The people? They are like you and me. Only
perhaps they don’t like to lie all the afternoon in the
sun, the way you and I do,” he added, stretching his
arms out wide in the sand and following a gull into
the sky.</p>

<p>“Are they good?” pursued the fisherman. Goodness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
as applied to character has come in Italian to
mean compliance rather than the sterner moral qualities
expected in the North.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps they are more apt to be ‘bad’ if
one is from another country. I think it is because
they do not understand. They speak another language,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Can you understand it?”</p>

<p>“M-m-m, generally.”</p>

<p>“Say some!” demanded the fisherman. And after
it he required a translation of the painter’s phrase.
“It is strange,” he commented. “When you say
those words I understand nothing; but you are saying
the same things that we say in Italian!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the painter. “They do not tell you
new things in other countries. At first it sounds different,
and then you find out that it is really the
same....”</p>

<p>“Why, have you been to many of them?”</p>

<p>“I have been to some others.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about them. Are they like America?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on the whole. Only some are a little hotter,
some are a little colder. Then there are countries
where the people are all black, you know—but really
black, like your head. Or yellow, or red. There are
countries, too, where the men dress like women; and
others where they go like us, without any clothes at
all. And I went once to one where it was light at
night.”</p>

<p>The fisherman edged a little closer, his eyes fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
on the painter as if to win the secret of his
strangeness and his fortune.</p>

<p>“If you have been so far you must have been on
a steamer,” he uttered slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I would like to go on a steamer, a big one, especially
at night. Did you ever put your head through
one of the little round windows where the lights are,
and look down at the dark sea, and find a <i>bragozzo</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the painter, “and I have seen
the light from the little windows touch the sails, and
the faces of the men looking up.”</p>

<p>“And then you passed and left them in the night.
How I wish I could have done that! But I was down
in the <i>bragozzo</i>, and you were up in the great lighted
ship, going to the countries at the end of the sea.”</p>

<p>The wistfulness in his face hurt the painter, to
whom the sense of the superiority of that perfect
body, and of the simple life from which it had won its
beauty and its strength, was keener than ever. He
had meant only to entertain his companion, not to
sharpen in him the sharpness of desire. How could
he put convincingly what he really felt? But the
fisherman went on, his face hanging almost over the
painter’s.</p>

<p>“Have you been to all the countries in the world?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Only to a few of them. And I don’t care
to see the rest.”</p>

<p>“Why not? If I were like you, and had no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
else to think about, and could do my trade in any
country, I would go to see them all.”</p>

<p>“But why? You do not see new things when you
travel. It is not worth while going on long journeys
to see people who wear different clothes from ours,
or have a different skin. They are always really the
same. They are all born in the same way, and they
all love and hate in the same way, and they all work
to get bread and fish, and then they all die. These
are the real things, the old things that people hide
under their customs and their languages. You can
see them here as well as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“It will be so,” said the fisherman humbly. “You
know better than I. But one gets tired of just the
same thing every day, every week, every month,
every year. It is like a week without Sunday. You
have had your <i>festa</i>, but I never had mine.”</p>

<p>“What you call <i>festa</i> was every day to me, and it
did not make me happy.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish I could have had your every day.”
He glanced out to sea a moment, where the fishing
boats were tacking about as if to no purpose but to
show off their butterfly wings. “Have you ever been
hungry?” he asked, looking down at the painter
again.</p>

<p>“No.” The painter crushed a temptation to play
with double meanings, and was ashamed to count
the few dinners deferred that he could remember.</p>

<p>“I have,” said the fisherman. “I have gone back
to Malamocco on a winter morning after a night in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the <i>bragozzo</i>, and I have had to show my empty
hands to my wife who was waiting at the door. And
I have hunted in the fog for the Porto di Lido, when
we tacked up and down outside, afraid to run in,
until we were so cold and tired that I hoped the boat
would go down. And I have seen my father’s dead
body washed up by the sea. These are the things
that I have seen. But you——”</p>

<p>The painter sprang out of his lazy posture.</p>

<p>“What are the things I have seen to those!” he
cried. “What do I know of the world, compared to
you? You have seen more of life here in Malamocco
than I ever did in all the strange cities I have seen!
It is nothing to know how men say ‘Good-morning’
in other languages or how they look in foreign coats,
if you know what they say on the decks of sinking
ships, and how they look when they are washed up
dead by the sea!”</p>

<p>For a moment the fisherman was silent, surprised
by the other’s vehemence. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. But what good does it do me to
know these things? I would rather have your <i>mestiere</i>.
It is not so monotonous. It is not so hard.
It is not so sad——”</p>

<p>The painter jumped impatiently to his feet. He
wanted to prove in some palpable way the inferiority
of his manner of life, so that the fisherman could not
help being convinced.</p>

<p>“Get up!” he cried. “Wrestle with me!”</p>

<p>“What shall I wrestle with you for?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
fisherman in astonishment, sitting back with his
hands propped behind him in the sand. “I want to
talk about these things.”</p>

<p>“You shall talk about these things afterward,”
laughed the painter. “Now I want to see how easily
I can throw you. Get up!”</p>

<p>The fisherman obeyed slowly and stood, loose-jointed,
waiting to see what the other would do. The
painter suddenly clinched him, at which the fisherman’s
muscles reacted instinctively. There was a
short sharp tussle; and the painter found himself on
his back in the sand, panting, the other’s knee on his
chest.</p>

<p>“You see?” demanded the painter.</p>

<p>The fisherman rolled down in the sand beside him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said. “When I felt you catch
me I didn’t think, and I put you down.”</p>

<p>The painter laughed.</p>

<p>“Now you see how much better your trade is than
mine?”</p>

<p>“No. What have trades to do with it? One of us
had to go under. Another time you would probably
beat me. Let’s try again. Come!”</p>

<p>He started to get up, but the painter pulled him
back.</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well that I couldn’t beat you
if I tried all day! Look at that!” He held out his
arm this time, and made the fisherman do the same.
“And look at that!” He stretched a lean white leg
beside the muscular brown one of the fisherman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
The comparison made him wince, as he marked again
how toil and peril had only wrought on the other’s
body like surpassing sculpture. He went on: “There
is no reason why I should not be as strong and as
good to look at as you. I am perhaps no older, and
I am not ill, and I have never been hurt. Then why
are we so different? It is just this very thing—the
difference between our <i>mestieri</i>. For when you were
pulling up nets on the sand, I was making little paper
sunsets for people to buy—when they could have
new and better ones every day for nothing, by looking
out of the window! And when you were watching
the stars play behind your sail, I was sitting in stuffy
rooms. Lamps are not so good for one as stars! And
when you were fighting the sea in storms, I was running
about the world trying to find some new thing.
And so you are what you are, and I am this!” He
looked down at himself and laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“That may be,” said the fisherman, puzzled and
a little embarrassed. “But what if I am strong?
You are strong enough. You have not been prevented
from enjoying. Was it worth while for me to
do all those things just to be able to put you down?
What difference does it make to me? I would rather
have been in your place.”</p>

<p>“No! Outside things cannot make you happy,
unless they fit with something inside. And the
things which make happiness are so few and so simple
that anybody can find them—like love, and sunshine.
That is all the good my journeys have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
me—to teach me this. I know these things, but
you have them.” He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>The fisherman looked at him a long time saying
nothing. When finally he spoke it was humbly, as
one lower to one higher.</p>

<p>“What you say must be true, because you understand
and I do not. Still—I wish I could be once on
a lighted ship at night, and go to one of the countries
at the end of the sea. I have never been, and you
have....”</p>

<p>At first the painter did not answer, his eyes on
the bronzed figure beside him. But then he smiled,
curiously.</p>

<p>“Look!” he said. “We are all covered with the
sand of the sea. We must brush it off and go back
into the world.”</p>

<p>She so far forgot the respect due to a minister’s
wife, and that reserve which should be the
portion of a maiden lady, as to forsake her chair for
the window. Peering discreetly through her lattice
of geraniums, she regarded with tense interest the
actions of a gentleman who was emerging from a
buggy in front of her neighbour’s house. This person,
after securing his horse to a ringed post, made his
way with some deliberation toward the door.</p>

<p>“He’s taken on flesh,” pursued Miss Cockerill.
She drew a trifle to one side in order to share her
opportunity with her visitor, but losing nothing of
what it was vouchsafed her to behold during the interval
between the pull at the bell and the opening
of the door. “She keeps him waitin’, same as she’s
done for twenty years,” commented the spectator.</p>

<p>The door at which he sued closed behind the expectant
gentleman who had “taken on flesh.” And
as Miss Cockerill’s most piercing gaze failed to penetrate
that exasperating barrier, she turned apologetically:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“You see, Mis’ Webster, I’ve known Martha
Waring ever since we were that high.” She indicated
an altitude above the floor about equal to that of an
ambitious kitten. “She was born in that very house,
and I was born in this, and now we’re the only ones
left of our folks. So it seems like I knew more about
her than I did about myself.”</p>

<p>It is to be feared that Mrs. Webster, lately come
from more impersonal atmospheres to that of Ackerton,
made small effort to discourage the revelations
which it not seldom befell her to hear. On the contrary,
she made it a point to regard them as among
the roses which garnish the rather thorny path of
young divines and their wives.</p>

<p>“A friendship like that is charming,” she remarked.
“It is not many that survive the perils of childhood.
You are both fortunate in having such constant
friends.”</p>

<p>“H’m! It’s a pity she don’t see it!” exclaimed
Miss Cockerill somewhat grimly. “Like as not she’ll
tell Jonas Lane to go back out West.”</p>

<p>“Jonas Lane?” echoed Mrs. Webster with diplomatic
interrogation. “Mr. Lane? I don’t seem to
remember that name.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t,” agreed Miss Cockerill
promptly. “His family’s all dead, like the rest of
ours, and he went away twenty years ago—after he’d
proposed to Martha the first time.”</p>

<p>“O!” exclaimed Mrs. Webster with discreet non-committal.
But there was that in the regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
she cast upon Miss Cockerill which did not deter
that lady from continuing:</p>

<p>“He’s only been back twice since. That was when
he proposed to her the second and third times. Now
I s’pose he’s doing it the fourth.”</p>

<p>She looked out of the window again, at the house
in which so momentous an event should be taking
place. The house gave no hint, however, of being
the abode of passion. It stood back in its maple-shaded
yard, more trim and respectable in its clap-boarded
dove-colour than a thing of nature, but as
indifferent to human palpitations. The eyes of both
ladies devoted to it an interval of silence. Then
Miss Cockerill turned once more to her companion:</p>

<p>“I don’t see how she can refuse him this time.
You see the first time she had her father an’ mother
and Anne. Her father was real sickly, and Anne
took after him. They both lay abed for years. Father
Waring did because he fell from the hay loft. But
Anne did because her father did, I guess. Anyhow,
when Jonas first proposed to Martha, twenty years
ago, she said she liked him well enough but that she
couldn’t leave her folks while they needed her. So
Jonas went out West, he was that provoked. He
did mighty well, too. He went into lumber, and he’s
a rich man now. But he didn’t forget Martha, for all
that. He was always as faithful as you’d want to
see—from the time he was a boy and we all went to
school together.”</p>

<p>Miss Cockerill let her eye return to the dove-coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
house with a reminiscent light which quickened
Mrs. Webster’s interest.</p>

<p>“He asked me to keep him informed of what went
on here. He wasn’t a great hand at writin’, and
Martha wasn’t either. And so after her father died
he came back. She told him she wasn’t ready,
though. An’ ’twas the same when Anne went. Martha
said she liked him just as much as ever, and
maybe more, but that her duty was with her mother.
Jonas said then he’d marry her mother, too. He was
always a great hand at his jokes, was Jonas. But
Martha said her mother wanted to spend her last
days at home, and so Jonas had to go off the third
time. Seems like Martha knew her own mind better
than most folks.”</p>

<p>Again Miss Cockerill paused a moment and contemplated
the fateful grey house.</p>

<p>“That was twelve years ago,” she resumed. “And
it’s hardly a fortnight since Mis’ Waring was laid in
her grave, and here comes Jonas knocking again at
Martha’s door. Guess she’ll have to let him in this
time. Anyway, I’ll know as soon as anybody. Jonas
always promised that he’d tell me first.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Mrs. Webster that she found a
certain parallel between the decently painted clap-boards
to which her attention had thus been drawn
and the somewhat inscrutable exterior of her hostess.
There was more within than appeared on the surface.
As for Miss Cockerill, her gaze had an intensity
which walls of brass could scarcely have withstood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
And as if the house could keep its secret from her no
longer, Jonas Lane suddenly emerged upon the veranda.</p>

<p>“He’s coming over now, I do believe!” exclaimed
Miss Cockerill excitedly, endeavouring to make the
most of the window without appearing from the outside
to do so.</p>

<p>Jonas, however, strode down the path, untied his
horse, threw the halter into the back of the buggy,
got in with much less deliberation than he had got
out, and drove rapidly away.</p>

<p>Miss Cockerill watched the buggy until it disappeared
in the long elm vista. Then, after another
glance at the grey house, she turned to her visitor.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” she burst forth. “If she hasn’t
refused him again!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Jonas Lane knocked for the fourth time
upon Martha Waring’s door his expectancy was a
quaint blend of eagerness and humour.</p>

<p>“Seems like things look more spruce than they did
last time,” he thought, eyeing the polished knocker,
the panels of the door, the slightly inclined planks of
the veranda, and the flagstones of the path running
back to the kitchen. “That there hemlock’s grown
a pile, too. They planted that ’twixt last time and
the time before, in place of the old pine that was
struck by lightnin’. Marthy never kept me so long
though,” he murmured impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Then the edge of the door began receding, very
gently; and when it reached a point which might
afford the possibility of ingress or egress to a pet
animal a lady’s head approached the aperture. It
was Miss Waring, come to parley through the
postern.</p>

<p>“Why, Jonas, is that you?” she exclaimed, a faint
glow suddenly brightening her countenance.</p>

<p>“Same old penny!” rejoined that worthy, putting
forth his hand.</p>

<p>At the sight of this friendly member Miss Waring
enlarged the aperture over which she stood guard
and drew her visitor in. Not only was it the proper
and Christian thing to do, but she had a disturbing
intuition of neighbourly eyes. Closing the door as
gently as she had opened it, she led the way into the
parlour, raised the shades, and took a seat opposite
her suitor.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that while Miss Waring had
received no immediate warning of this visit—Jonas
being, as Miss Cockerill had intimated to Mrs. Webster,
no great hand at writing—she had nevertheless
been led by experience to entertain a premonition
of Jonas’ arrival not long after any change in her
own family circle. And on this occasion she was
more uncertain of herself than she had ever been.
For the last ditch was lost; and now the invader
threatened her very person she knew not whether to
surrender or to withstand till the last drop of blood.
She wished that she had had more time to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>It was evident that Jonas, too, as he sat twirling
his hat and gazing from his hostess to her furniture,
felt a little less than his customary assurance.</p>

<p>It was the woman, however, who relieved the situation
by uttering:</p>

<p>“I hope you’re feeling well, Jonas. You’re looking
just the same as ever.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Marthy,” rejoined her interlocutor.
“You’re lookin’ just about the same, too; but I hope
you’re feelin’ different.” And before Miss Waring
could recover from this bold attack, Jonas went on:
“You know I ain’t no hand at beatin’ about the
bush, Marthy. I might as well tell you here and
now what I’ve come for. I guess you know well
enough, though, without my tellin’. You’ve had
chance aplenty to learn what it means when I come
here. But this time I ain’t going away without
ye. Be I now, Marthy?”</p>

<p>He rose from his place on the sofa and approached
her. But then he stopped, acutely embarrassed. His
blind desire for vicinity had no definite intent, and
he did not know just what to do. As for Martha, she
stretched out her palms like a barrier before her, and
gasped:</p>

<p>“O, Jonas! Don’t say such things!”</p>

<p>Unexpected as it was, that gave him definiteness.
Sitting down beside the lady of his heart Jonas laid
a gnarled finger on her knee.</p>

<p>“I know it’s kind of unfair to come on ye sudden
like, Martha, just after you’ve lost your mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“But if anybody kin comfort ye, I’m the man to do it.
I just couldn’t wait a minute longer. I’ve waited
purty long, Marthy.”</p>

<p>Martha brushed away the audacious finger, and
covered her face with her hands like a nymph
at bay.</p>

<p>“O, don’t, Jonas!” she moaned.</p>

<p>Her gentle faun made no further attempt at violence,
but looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>“Marthy!” he groaned: “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>There was that in his voice which at last compelled
Martha to reply, haltingly:</p>

<p>“I mean—Jonas—that I—just can’t—go back
with you!”</p>

<p>Jonas at first could not speak. Then he said
gravely:</p>

<p>“You’re only jokin’ and beatin’ about the bush,
Marthy. It’s the way women folks have. But
what’s the use of doin’ it with me? You can’t mean
it. Didn’t ye always tell me that you liked me real
well, and that when there was nothin’ to keep ye
you’d come?”</p>

<p>Martha so far recovered her composure as to let
her hands resume their customary position in her
lap; but her cheeks and her voice betrayed the
moral stress under which she laboured.</p>

<p>“I know I did, Jonas,” she said. “And I meant it.
But somehow it seems different, now the time has
come. I do like you real well, and I always did. But
it seems like I couldn’t leave this old house where I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was born and where all my people died, and go off
among strangers. I just can’t, Jonas!”</p>

<p>With which deliverance she raised a neatly folded
handkerchief to her eyes, and held it there. Poor
Jonas looked on with the double helplessness of a
man before a woman’s tears, and of a lover in the
face of his mistress’s perversities. Of what all this
could mean he had not the slightest idea. But he
felt ill-used, although a great deference put him in a
mood of concession.</p>

<p>“But you promised, Marthy,” he said gently.
“And how can you live here all by yourself? Who
will look out for you?”</p>

<p>“I know I promised, Jonas,” tearfully murmured
Miss Waring; “and I just hate to go back on my
word. But it comes over me now that I oughtn’t to
have promised—that I never could have done it.
You needn’t bother about my living alone, though,
I’ve always looked out for people, instead of their
looking out for me. I shouldn’t know what to
do in a strange house, with everything done for
me.”</p>

<p>For a moment Jonas looked lost. But then he
burst out:</p>

<p>“Why, bless your heart, Marthy, that’s easy
enough to fix! You needn’t go away and have people
look out for you at all. You can stay right on here,
and I’ll come and live with you, instead of taking
you away, and then you’ll still have somebody to
look out for!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>At this sudden change of front Miss Waring lowered
her flag of truce and looked at the enemy
askance.</p>

<p>“What is it, Marthy?” inquired that gentleman
anxiously. “Won’t that suit ye?”</p>

<p>Evidently Martha had never entertained such a
possibility. And of this she presently gave verbal
assurance, in a tone of the most doubting.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that, Jonas,” she said slowly.
“It would seem so odd to live here and have a
stranger in the house.”</p>

<p>“A stranger, Marthy!” expostulated Jonas piteously.
“I, a stranger! And whose fault is it if I’m
a stranger to you? But never mind about that,” he
added hastily. “Just give me a chance, and we’ll
get acquainted fast enough! Won’t ye, Marthy—dear?”
He uttered the last word timidly and drew
nearer his love.</p>

<p>This lady felt her heart as water within her. Indeed,
a little of it exuded from her eyes, to the further
confusion and agony of Jonas Lane.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Marthy?” he cried. “For
mercy’s sake tell me! Heaven knows I don’t want to
make you feel bad! I only want to make you happy
and to be happy with you—as I’ve looked forward
to for twenty years.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Jonas,” conceded the lady of his
dreams. “And I hate to be like this. But—it would
be so odd—so odd! And if you came here I s’pose
we’d have to be—married——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>As she paused, plucking at a fold of her skirt, the
wondering Jonas broke in:</p>

<p>“I rather guess we’d have to, Marthy.”</p>

<p>“O Jonas! Don’t!” supplicated Miss Waring with
an agonised blush. “I just meant—that I could
never go through it—and live.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Marthy?” inquired Jonas,
utterly dazed.</p>

<p>“Why, I mean,” explained Miss Waring hesitantly,
“that there’d have to be a dress. And I never
could go down to the store and ask to see white satin,
and buy ever and ever so many yards of it, and take
it to Hannah Lee, and tell her to make me up a—a
wedding gown. I never could in the world. Everybody
would know, and talk, and I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose they’d have to know,” said Jonas apologetically.
“There’s too much of me to be hid. Is
that all?”</p>

<p>“No,” pursued Martha, relentlessly implanting
another dart in her lover’s bosom. “There’d have
to be a wedding. And I’ll do a good deal for you,
Jonas, but I’ll never stand up with you before the
minister and have everybody whispering about
Martha Waring and her old beau Jonas Lane, and
how they’ve got married at last, and it’s a pity they
didn’t do it afore.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity, Marthy,” admitted the doleful Jonas,
“but——”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the worst, though,” continued Martha,
to whom the whole grim scene unfolded itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
its entirety. “The worst would be the rice. They’d
throw it at us when we went away, and the people on
the cars would see, and it would stick in our clothes,
and roll out wherever we went, and everybody would
know, and laugh. O Jonas, I can’t! I’m sorry, but
I just can’t!”</p>

<p>To poor Jonas world within world of undreamt
feminine perversity had of a sudden been revealed.
He felt as one bound by cobwebs. But, after staring
for some moments in silence at his liege lady, he addressed
her again the word.</p>

<p>“Marthy Warin’,” he asked solemnly, “would you
marry me if you could do it without rice, and without
a weddin’ dress, and without anybody’s knowin’?”</p>

<p>She regarded him with doubt.</p>

<p>“Seems like it wouldn’t be really getting married,”
she objected incautiously.</p>

<p>The face of Jonas darkened with despair. After
this, what was there to hope? Martha, however, returned
shamefacedly to her guns.</p>

<p>“I would though, Jonas, if I could.”</p>

<p>“Honour bright, Marthy? Will ye promise?” demanded
that gentleman, visibly expanding.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Jonas, if there was a way,” breathed
the hunted victim.</p>

<p>“All right,” exclaimed the victor cheerfully, rising
forthwith. “We’ll elope then! And now you’ve
promised, I’m going off to see about it.”</p>

<p>With which he departed, before the agitated Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Waring had time to protest against the base advantage
which had been taken of her defenceless condition.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The soul of Miss Cockerill was ground to powder
between wrath and desire. The expected had happened,
and neither Jonas Lane nor Martha Waring
had told her a word about it. Martha Lane, she
supposed she’d have to say now. They were ungrateful
as owls, she did declare. All the years she’d
known them—and Jonas Lane almost as much her
beau as Martha’s! She didn’t know which to be
maddest at: Jonas, who had promised to tell her
first of anybody in the world, after Martha; or Martha,
who had told her everything ever since she was
old enough to have anything to tell. But she
couldn’t live there next door to them and never
make a sign. They’d think it queer—well, as they’d
all known each other. And it didn’t seem as if she
could wait to hear about it all. The idea of their
running off and getting married like that, and setting
everybody to talk!</p>

<p>So, putting her pride in her pocket—a convenience
which the modes of Ackerton permitted her—and a
shawl over her head, she walked across to Martha’s
kitchen door.</p>

<p>That lady opened it, beaming consciously.</p>

<p>“Well, Susan! We began to think we’d have to
go over and see you first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Miss Cockerill eyed her hostess curiously. The
change in her spiritual condition, however, had apparently
wrought no corresponding physical metamorphosis.</p>

<p>“I would have taken it kindly, Martha,” rejoined
the visitor. “You an’ Jonas going off so sudden-like
kind o’ took my breath away.”</p>

<p>If Miss Cockerill succeeded in dissembling the
poignancy of her emotions, Mrs. Lane nevertheless
found means to detect it.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder, Susan!” exclaimed that matron.
“It took mine away, too, and I’ve hardly got it back
yet. But Jonas would have it so.” With which interesting
information she drew her friend toward
the sitting room. “Come in and let’s visit a little.
I haven’t seen you for such a while and dinner isn’t
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Miss Cockerill looked about her as they went. It
seemed to her that events so momentous must leave
a mark upon their material surroundings. But the
old house looked exactly as she had known it for
nearly fifty years. Mrs. Lane observed these glances,
and interpreted them in her own way.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t here,” she smiled. “There’s too
much of him to be hid, as he says. He’s gone down
to the store to do some trading. But let me tell you
all about it. It’s only fair as you should know, being
such an old friend of both of ours.” With which the
two ladies settled themselves for a long session.</p>

<p>“You see it was this way,” began the bride, examining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
her apron as if for inspiration. “You know
how it always was between Jonas and me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Miss Cockerill inscrutably.</p>

<p>“And you know how I always felt, so long as any
of my family were left—that my first duty was with
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” repeated Miss Cockerill.</p>

<p>“Well, when Jonas came on this time, so soon after
mother’s death, he found me all upset. It was the
change, I s’pose, and the loneliness, and the having
no one to look out for. And when he spoke of taking
me away I just couldn’t go. So we arranged that he
should come here instead. And I can’t help being
glad it was so. It isn’t so hard for him, as ’twould
be for me to go ’way out where he lives.”</p>

<p>“Where he lived,” suggested Miss Cockerill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane accepted the amendment with a smile.</p>

<p>“And when we came to talk things over we decided
we didn’t want any publicity—and I just in mourning,
you know.” Mrs. Lane noted that this point
told. “We didn’t know just how to manage, though.
Jonas, he was for going before the justice. But I
told him as how I wouldn’t feel right if I wasn’t married
by a minister. Then he wanted we should go off
somewheres and get married before a strange minister,
so as nobody should know till it was all over.
Eloping, he called it, like a story book. But I told
him I wouldn’t have any goings on like novels, and
that if I couldn’t be married by my own minister I
wouldn’t be married at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Miss Cockerill. “After all the
time he’s waited! I thought you told him something,
though, from the way he left the house the day
he came back. I said as much to Mis’ Webster. She
was with me at the time.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? ’Twas Mrs. Webster that finally
fixed it up with Jonas. It simply used me up, and he
told me to leave it to him and he’d get us married
by the minister without any fuss and feathers—or
rice,” she added.</p>

<p>“How did they do it?” inquired Miss Cockerill.</p>

<p>“Well, I invited the minister and his wife and
Jonas in to dinner,” answered the bride. “I naturally
would have had you, Susan, if I’d had anybody
outside. But Mrs. Webster had to know about it,
being the minister’s wife, and she was really the one
that managed, and as long as ’twas that way it
seemed a comfort to have some other woman
there. I felt awful mean, though, not telling you,
Susan.”</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the opinions of the lady
addressed, she diplomatically concealed them behind
a veil of impatience.</p>

<p>“What happened then?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, before going to the table, we two stood up
in front of Mr. Webster, and he married us. Then
we sat down just as if nothing had happened. I was
that scared, though, lest somebody should come in
before we got to our victuals, that I kept my eye out
the window all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“What did you have on?” inquired Miss Cockerill.
“You didn’t have much time to get things made.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t want to, being in mourning you
know. And that Hannah Lee never could hold her
tongue, anyway! So I just wore my grey silk, and
Jonas said we’d get whatever else we wanted when
we were away.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Miss Cockerill. “And then?”</p>

<p>“And then Mr. and Mrs. Webster went away, carrying
my bag with the few things I needed, and Jonas
went back to the hotel, and I stayed and did up the
dishes.”</p>

<p>“What was all that for?” queried Miss Cockerill.
“I should think Jonas might ha’ stayed with his own
wife.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t want he should. People might have
thought it strange if they’d come in. And the Websters
took my bag because they were going to be in
their team down at the end of the garden lot, and I
was going out as if to pick chrysanthemums, and
they were going to ask me to take a ride with
them.”</p>

<p>“Why in the world did you have them there?”
demanded the intrepid Susan.</p>

<p>“Why, because it was less conspicuous,” explained
Mrs. Lane. “They’d just been here to dinner and had
gone away, and if they’d come back afterwards, it
might have looked queer. I wanted it to be as if I
saw them by chance like, out back there. Well, after
my dishes were all done up, and everything was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
order, and the house locked tight for going away, I
went upstairs and got ready. But when the time
came it seemed as if I could never go in the world.
I just stood at the back door in my things and
couldn’t budge. ’Twas only the idea of Jonas going
off alone by himself in the cars that started me. So I
opened the door, very softly, and stepped out as light
as I could, and locked it behind me, and made for
the garden. I was just sure that you or somebody
would see me and call out, and I didn’t know what I
should say; and I was so scared I couldn’t hardly see.
I did hear some kind of a noise, too, and that made
me run. And I ran so fast I actually fell down,
Susan—flat on the ground!”</p>

<p>“My!” exclaimed that sympathetic auditor. “Did
you spoil your dress?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near. I was all over dirt when I finally
got to the carriage, and so out of breath I couldn’t
open my mouth, and that nervous I could have cried.
I guess I did some, too. But Mrs. Webster just held
my hand, and Mr. Webster talked about the weather
and the crops and Jonas and everything, as natural
as natural. And by and by I perked up. And we
had a perfectly lovely ride to West Carthage.”</p>

<p>“Jonas met you there then, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“No—or at least not just then. I wouldn’t have
had him for the world. Such lots of Ackerton folks
go to West Carthage.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go away together at all, then?” inquired
Miss Cockerill sardonically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“Why, of course we did!” cried the bride. “Jonas
came in on the train. He was to be in the last car
but one, sitting in the tenth seat from the back on
the right-hand side—away from the station. Well,
we got there just a little before time, and nobody
could have told who was going. And when the train
came in Mrs. Webster kissed me, and Mr. Webster
shook hands, and they both said real nice things, and
hoped I’d find Jonas all right; and then I got out
and got on the car just as it started.”</p>

<p>“And did you find Jonas all right?” pursued the
quizzical Miss Cockerill.</p>

<p>“You know well enough you don’t need to ask
that, Susan Cockerill!” exclaimed Mrs. Lane. “You
always find Jonas when he says so. He was right
there where he said, looking as if he’d just stolen
cream.”</p>

<p>“I should think he’d ha’ been scared when the
train started and you wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. If he was he didn’t show it. He
just said he was used to waiting for me.”</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Cockerill regarded her friend
in silence. Then she remarked some what cryptically:</p>

<p>“Well, if I’d known it was as easy as that gettin’
married, I’d ha’ done it myself!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUSANNAH_AND_THE_ELDER">SUSANNAH AND THE ELDER</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>There was also a Younger.</p>

<p>He had just come down from Florence,
where a white umbrella was no longer proof
against the August sun, and where even the secular
shades of the Uffizi had grown intolerable. But
whether Viareggio were an effective substitute was a
debatable question. To have sought refuge from
the dim-roomed palaces above the Arno in a pink
casino required other justification than that of greater
security against the attacks of Phœbus, while the
charms of a ragged pine wood and of a dubious monument
to Shelley hardly threw the scale against the
Piazza della Signoria. But there was their Ligurian
Sea, as absurdly overcoloured as a lithograph, which
one might splash in all day long, whereas in all
Tuscany was there scarcely water enough to wet
your finger withal. And, too, there were people.</p>

<p>So the Younger stood in the doorway of the Casino
terrace and smiled. For while the <i>Stabilimento</i>, like
all respectable <i>Stabilimenti</i>, was rigidly divided into
two equal halves, with the dressing-rooms of the
sheep on the right hand and those of the goats on
the left of the central café, it was noticeable that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
spectators tended to scatter themselves in precisely
the opposite sense. What chiefly caused the Younger
to smile, however, was that at the extreme right-hand
corner table he recognised the back of the Elder.
This personage, upon whom time had already impressed
a seal only too legible, was what it pleased
the Younger to call a type; and in types he conceived
that he found a peculiar profit. Since the Elder,
despite his worldly degree, was known in Florentine
circles for his assiduity among the studios—not so
much in the quality of patron of the arts as in that
of amateur of the society to be found therein—what
could be more in character than his present
post? And if the Younger happened to be better
acquainted with the back which he now beheld than
with its patrician obverse, he found in that circumstance
nothing to prevent his edging through the
crowd to the extreme right-hand corner table.</p>

<p>“Ah, the long American painter!” cried the Elder,
greeting him with the effusion whose secret is alone to
the Latin race. “You have come to look for models,
eh?” He waved his hand toward the more or less exposed
forms disporting themselves on the sands below.</p>

<p>The Younger laughed.</p>

<p>“Your opportunities are limited here,” he said.
“You should go to an American watering-place. There
young men and maidens, old men and children,
dressed and undressed, sport together with a promiscuity!
You would imagine yourself by the waters
of Eden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Cosi?</i>” The Elder looked up a moment. “But
after all, a little formality is better—a little illusion.”</p>

<p>“Illusion!” cried the Younger. “In the red and
white stripes so bountifully provided by the <i>Stabilimento</i>!
I can conceive of no surer cure for love than
to chain the unhappy victim to this corner and force
him to behold his inamorata in the full horror of her
dishabille. It would be a disillusionment which no
passion could survive.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” rejoined the Elder, “you will
shortly behold a vision whose like you might seek in
vain beside your waters of Eden.”</p>

<p>The Younger laughed again.</p>

<p>“There is already a vision, is there? In red and
white stripes? You must be worse off than usual,
for this spectacle is positively indecent. It is more.
It is revolting. There ought to be a law limiting
public bathing to persons between the ages of—say—three
and thirty-three, with special clauses excluding
individuals of inadequate or intolerable dimensions!”</p>

<p>The Elder laughed in turn.</p>

<p>“That is why I am too vain to expose myself.
There is an irrepressible democracy of the flesh which
is fatal to the most exclusive triumphs of the tailor.
But wait till you see Dulcinea.”</p>

<p>“Who is she this time?” inquired the Younger
airily.</p>

<p>The Elder turned upon him a reproachful but an
unoffended monocle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“If she were respectable I would marry her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” uttered the Younger, slowly. “And are
you respectable? Not, of course, that I mean to imply
anything against a Marquis of Tuscany.”</p>

<p>The Elder dropped his monocle.</p>

<p>“What will you have? Things are like that. Besides,
women don’t care. In fact they are all the
more flattered to have been chosen last. It proves
their pretensions.”</p>

<p>“O!” grinned the Younger. “And who is the last?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows. Some say she is a diva from
Paris; others that she is a <i>danseuse</i> from Vienna; and
others—But she is here on some caprice. She is
waiting for someone. I have tried to make her think
it was for me. I have made eyes. I have smiled. I
have sighed. I have wept. I have sent flowers. I
have written poems. I have thrown myself in her
path. But she does not look. She goes about like
anybody. She has her—you know—with her——an
old fat one.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that she is not somebody?”
demanded the Younger.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see!” admonished the Elder darkly.
“Does anybody <i>flâne</i> about alone and refuse to
speak? Does anybody wear diamonds in the day-time?
Does anybody drag frills from the Rue de la
Paix over the sands of the sea? Does anybody come
to a hole like Viareggio when they might be at
Venice or Scheveningen or Deauville?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>The Younger, highly entertained by this impassioned
picture, was on the point of pursuing his inquiries
when the Elder evinced a sudden excitement.</p>

<p>“Look!” he whispered, replacing his monocle.</p>

<p>The Younger looked. He saw a woman, extremely
young, extremely pretty, extremely self-possessed,
and even extremely chic, in her surrender of the red-and-white
stripes of Viareggio for a bathing dress
more modish, advance slowly toward the water. She
was followed by an older lady, who had long since
capitulated before the stoutness of middle life.</p>

<p>“Do you see?” cried the Elder. “Can anybody
look like that and be respectable?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed the Younger. “Why in the
world haven’t you guessed?”</p>

<p>“Who, pray?” the Elder demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, who but an American?”</p>

<p>“O-o-o! I never thought of that.” And in the
light of a new hypothesis he began to examine Dulcinea
afresh. After a prolonged scrutiny he spoke
again: “What do you make of the old one then, on
your theory?”</p>

<p>“Why, who should she be but the girl’s mother?”</p>

<p>“Do mothers let their daughters go like that—even
in America?”</p>

<p>“Like what? Her mother seems to be going
farther than she.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; you haven’t seen,” rejoined the other.
“But I don’t believe it,” he burst out. “How do
you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“How do I know?” mused the Younger. “How
could I help knowing—after one look. Blood is thicker
than water: an electric sympathy assures me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, an electric sympathy—when it is that one!”
grinned the Elder.</p>

<p>“Well, then, look at their hair. Haven’t all
Americans the same hair?”</p>

<p>The Elder glanced at him.</p>

<p>“You have, it is true. The mixture of races, I
suppose. But that is not enough.”</p>

<p>“If you absolutely demand conviction, then, I
know because they have been pointed out to me in
Florence by other Americans.”</p>

<p>“Florence!” exclaimed the Elder. “Impossible!
I would have seen them.”</p>

<p>“My dear Marquis,” retorted the Younger, “why
should you have seen them? Do I have to inform
you that Florence is one of the most considerable
American cities on this globe? There are many people
in Florence whom you do not see. As a matter
of fact, I happen to know that they live there—in a
<i>villino</i> outside the Porta Romana. I can even tell
you that they have no contract for it—so complete
in Florence is our knowledge about each other! They
came more than a year ago, saying that they were to
leave the next day. They have said so every day
since; but the landlord is as sure of them as if he had
a ten-year lease.”</p>

<p>“Who are they, then?” persisted the Elder.
“What else do your friends say about them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“Who are they! That is the one thing that nobody
knows,” replied the Younger.</p>

<p>“Ah, I told you they were not respectable!” proclaimed
the Elder in triumph.</p>

<p>The Younger was touched in his country’s honour.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” he objected warmly, “allow me to
inform you that you entirely misconceive the case.
I have not the slightest reason to suppose them other
than the perfected bloom of respectability. Have
you heard of our American inventions? Well, they
are one of them—a mother and daughter, unattached.
There are thousands in Florence. Rome is full of
them. Certain Swiss and German cities contain only
enough other inhabitants to lodge, feed, clothe, educate
and divert them. In America you meet them on
every corner. They have always emerged from some
pre-existent, perhaps some inferior state of being,
but without scandal; which, of course, is not to say
that they are immune from the frailties of the race.
But never be deceived by them again.”</p>

<p>The Elder smiled. “Must it be always that—a
mother and a daughter? Can’t there be two daughters?
Or another mother?”</p>

<p>“Never,” replied the Younger firmly. “If there
are, then it’s another invention.”</p>

<p>“But there must be a man,” objected the Elder.</p>

<p>“No,” insisted the Younger, “there isn’t. There
never is. You might ransack the universe and you
wouldn’t find him. It’s like spontaneous combustion—and
just as respectable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The object of this discussion being now indistinguishable
in the dazzle of the Mediterranean, the
Elder pursued his inquiry.</p>

<p>“If these ladies are of origin and habits so out of
the ordinary, do they have names?”</p>

<p>“Rather! They are called Perkins, I believe. The
young lady is Susannah. Her mamma is known
behind her back as The General.”</p>

<p>The Elder repeated these soft appellations to himself.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>“What do they do with themselves? Why have
I never met them in the world?”</p>

<p>“For the excellent reason that they don’t go. They
know no one. They see the dressmaker and a few
other Americans, and <i>basta</i>.”</p>

<p>“Ah! There must be something queer!” burst out
the Elder. “You haven’t told me all. Otherwise
how could they help not knowing everybody and
going everywhere?”</p>

<p>The Younger let out an exaggerated sigh.</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I have been trying to explain
to you,” he answered. “But it is true,” he
added; “I haven’t told you all.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew! What is it?” The Elder was hectic
in his eagerness.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the Younger, looking for his effect,
“Susannah is one of your literary ladies. She writes
a novel. Not novels, you understand, but a novel.
Some ladies keep house. Other ladies embroider tea-cloths.
A few occupy themselves with dogs, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
reforms. Susannah writes a novel. She is a portentous
blue-stocking.”</p>

<p>“Blue stocking! On that leg! Never!” exploded
the Elder. “I would give a thousand francs to know
her!”</p>

<p>The Younger regarded his companion quizzically.</p>

<p>“Would you really?”</p>

<p>“O you young men!” cried the Elder. “I don’t
know what you are made of nowadays. In my time
there was more fire. I repeat it—I would give a
thousand francs to know her, and it would be nothing.”</p>

<p>“All right,” smiled the Younger. “I’ll take you.”</p>

<p>“Take me? Where?” asked the mystified Elder.</p>

<p>“Why, to Susannah—for a thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“To Susannah! My poor young man, little you
know about it. I have been here a month, and it
isn’t so easy as you think.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” contradicted the Younger
suavely, “it is far easier than you think. I happen
to know a good deal about it, for I am personally acquainted
with her. I have shaken her hand, I have
dined at the <i>villino</i>, I——”</p>

<p>“Mother of Heaven!” The Elder furiously
clutched his arm. “You know her, and you talk like
this! You sit here calmly! You laugh! You lead
me by the nose! You——”</p>

<p>Words failed him, and he could only work his fingers
into the Younger’s muscles.</p>

<p>That young man tasted of his advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“You see in America they are all like that.”</p>

<p>“And you are here to say so? Then you are either
a monster or a liar.”</p>

<p>“Also,” continued the Younger placidly, “you
must remember that I am a poor devil of an artist,
while Susannah——”</p>

<p>“Ah, I will marry her yet!” cried the Elder with
a new enthusiasm. “Take me! Take me!”</p>

<p>“To Susannah, you mean? For a thousand francs?
I will. But wait till she comes out of the water.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>If Susannah and her mother were an American
invention, the Younger began to take as much pleasure
in them as if he had invented them himself.
And indeed, in a way, he had. Hitherto his acquaintance
with them had been less cordial, if anything,
than his acquaintance with the Elder. If
Susannah had maintained an armed truce, as it were,
because they were both strangers in a strange land,
he had cultivated Susannah merely as a type. There
was a lack, all around, of personalities. But now
that he had lightly thrown Susannah to the lions he
experienced a more particular interest in her case.
He promised himself from the reaction of his two
types some such entertainment as one might expect
from the encounter of an irresistible force with an
immovable obstacle.</p>

<p>He was not long re-established in Florence before
the Elder repaired one day to the Younger’s studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“It is all arranged,” he announced importantly.
“I am going to marry her.”</p>

<p>The Younger, it must be confessed, was a little
surprised that Susannah should have fallen so soon.
But he kept his guard.</p>

<p>“My dear marquis, let me congratulate you! Have
you set the day?”</p>

<p>“O, the details have yet to be arranged. But I
have spoken to her mother.”</p>

<p>A light began to break upon the Younger.</p>

<p>“And The General is favourable?”</p>

<p>“The General is favourable—most favourable.
She could not be favourable enough.”</p>

<p>I have not explained that Susannah’s parent, in
virtue of a striking resemblance to the Father of her
Country, and of certain military qualities which she
possessed, was known among her fellow exiles as The
General.</p>

<p>“I hope Susannah was equally favourable,” the
Younger lightly threw out.</p>

<p>“She was not there. But after the mother has
given her assurance——”</p>

<p>The Younger began incontinently to laugh.</p>

<p>“My poor marquis! Didn’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Know what?” demanded that nobleman uneasily.</p>

<p>“That the mother has nothing to do with it?”</p>

<p>“How has she nothing to do with it? She has
everything to do with it. Isn’t Susannah her daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“I have no reason to suspect the contrary. But
in our country—you know——”</p>

<p>“Well, what about this extraordinary country of
yours?”</p>

<p>“Why, in our country”—the Younger put it as
gently as he could—“we don’t ask the mother.”</p>

<p>“What in the world do you do then? Is it like the
Rape of the Sabines, <i>par exemple</i>! Do you ride in
and carry them off?”</p>

<p>“O, not a bit! Sometimes they ride in and carry
us off. But we—we are more discreet. We go in
very softly and ask them if they’ll come.”</p>

<p>“Without waking the mother up? I see! It’s another
invention.” The Elder was visibly annoyed.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried the Younger: “You needn’t be so
fierce. I didn’t invent it. You had better be congratulating
yourself that The General didn’t gobble you
up on the spot—for herself.”</p>

<p>The marquis looked very blank.</p>

<p>“Then I have done nothing?” he asked at
last.</p>

<p>“<i>Caro marchese</i>,” began the Younger soothingly,
“to have gained a friend is always to have done
something. It is very well to have The General on
your side. It will make her all the more amenable
when you come to the matter of settlements. For I
must warn you before it is too late that——”</p>

<p>“What?” The Elder braced himself as for another
blow.</p>

<p>“That we don’t make settlements.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>It was as if suddenly the Elder had seen a mountain
slide into the sea.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you make then?”</p>

<p>“We,” replied the Younger with a particular inflection,
“make love!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated the Elder.</p>

<p>And he turned on his heel.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>He let several suns go down on a certain stiffness
which he felt toward his young adviser. But that it
was no more than a stiffness was proven by his eventual
reappearance. The Younger in the meantime
was more or less in the dark as to the progress of
events. He knew that there was no break as yet;
but his previous acquaintance with Susannah and
The General had not been such as to entitle him to
their confidences. He was accordingly much pleased
when the Elder came back.</p>

<p>“This time I am ready for you,” observed that
worthy. “And I might add that she is ready for
me.”</p>

<p>The Younger’s intentions had been of the best;
but if you make a pass at a fencer his wrist will
spring instinctively into play.</p>

<p>“Which one?” he inquired, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Do you ask?” retorted the Elder.</p>

<p>“I stand corrected. Of course, you will have to
take them both. Have they given their word?”</p>

<p>“Ah—do you mean that the old one will be hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
to shake off?” put the Elder, with something less of
assurance.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I mean that neither of them can be
shaken off. It is a particularity of the case. It is
like the Siamese twins. Whoever takes one, takes
both. It is the one case of plural marriage tolerated
in my country.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” rejoined the Elder unperturbed,
“there will be no trouble about the settlements.”</p>

<p>The Younger took his pink with a laugh. “Then
you have been making the other thing. Have you
asked her yet?”</p>

<p>“No. But it comes to the same. I have sounded
her.”</p>

<p>“O! And she rang true? How did you manage
it?”</p>

<p>The Elder took his step without a tremour. “I
offered her a present and she accepted it.”</p>

<p>The Younger left him an instant in his security.</p>

<p>“Yes? What was it?”</p>

<p>“An antique pendant. At this moment it is hanging
against her heart.”</p>

<p>The Younger took this picture in, but he repressed
a laugh.</p>

<p>“My dear marquis, you might give her seventy-three
pendants, and I presume her heart is large
enough to hang all of them against it. But that
would prove nothing.”</p>

<p>The Elder looked reproach before he proffered it:</p>

<p>“You assure me she is respectable. How can she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
receive presents from a man, how can her mother allow
her to receive presents, unless she means something?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly well,” laughed the Younger irritatingly.</p>

<p>“And is that another, may I ask, of your famous
inventions?” put the Elder with some irony.</p>

<p>“It is perhaps the most famous of all,” replied the
younger, without a qualm. “We are a philosophic
people. We take what comes, whether it be diamonds
or bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but young girls!” burst out the Elder. “Can
they take diamonds and keep their characters?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly well! What have diamonds to do with
character? The young girls do not attach the exaggerated
importance to material things which you do
here. They receive necklaces, tiaras, stomachers, as
the merest natural tribute to their charms, and as
simply as they would receive wild flowers. It means
nothing.”</p>

<p>The Elder gasped.</p>

<p>“And would they be capable of refusing one after
that?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“<i>Madre di Dio!</i> What a society! What taste!
What——” He could say no more. But even in the
rapids he felt that the Younger was the only one to
pilot him ashore. “Do you positively mean to tell
me, then, that I am nowhere?”</p>

<p>The Younger relented a little.</p>

<p>“Of course I cannot read the secrets of Susannah’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
heart. For all I know you may be enshrined within
its inmost recess. I only tell you that the pendant,
by itself, means nothing.”</p>

<p>The Elder looked lost.</p>

<p>“Do I accomplish nothing, then, by what I have
done?”</p>

<p>“Only,” improvised the Younger briskly, “by following
it up. A pendant is very well, but it is not
enough. You see, in America anybody might give
her a pendant—the plumber, the ice-man, the under-taker.
You must do more. You must offer solid
proofs of your state of heart. You must find out
what Susannah wants. If it is something which can
be made to order, into which you can put something
of yourself, all the better. Then she will know that
you are in earnest, and will act accordingly.”</p>

<p>The Elder took it seriously—not in a pique, but as
under the enlarging influence of new ideas.</p>

<p>“I have heard her speak of something,” he uttered
slowly, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember those door knockers at Palazzo
Testadura? Bronze? By Benvenuto Cellini?”</p>

<p>“The Neptune, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She said she wished they had them at the
<i>villino</i>. They have nothing but an iron finger or
something, you know. I could have them copied—by
way of a beginning.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the Younger in a final burst of inspiration.
“And to give the personal note, to suggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
delicately the idea of your knocking at her door, you
could have the Neptune’s head modeled after your
own!”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Thus it came about that the genetic word was
spoken. To stop its effect was now beyond the power
of man. Thenceforward it remained for the Younger
only to stand by and admire his handiwork.</p>

<p>Events were by no means slow in materialising.
The Elder quickly reported on the knockers. Melconi,
the sculptor, had taken a cast and was to remodel
the head in accordance with the Younger’s
suggestion. The prospective donor was already engaged
upon a sequence of sonnets—in the manner of
Petrarch, he said—to accompany the gift. In the
meantime he had ascertained that Susannah would
not draw a tranquil breath until she possessed a certain
heraldic shield, an old stone coat-of-arms which
hung high above the street on the corner of a house
across the Arno. He had accordingly entered into
negotiation with the owner of the house, had acquired
for a fabulous sum the shield in question and had
borne it in triumph to the expectant Susannah.</p>

<p>This was but the beginning. The Younger no
longer needed to offer suggestions. The Elder’s own
imagination was fertilised, and now that he knew
how ladies were wooed in America he purposed to
win Susannah. That young woman expressed no
fleeting fancy which her admirer did not at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
embody for her in some form of art. She could not
look with favour on the moon but that the marquis
would run to order of his jeweller a replica of that
heavenly orb, in material far more precious than the
original. He could think only in terms of the idea
which the Younger had implanted in his mind. The
door of the <i>villino</i> swung unceasingly to messengers
from the goldsmith, the dealer in antiques, the florist,
the pastry cook. Even the upholsterer went,
and to all was displayed an equal hospitality.</p>

<p>At this the Younger began to feel a secret irritation.
He was amused. He was gratified to find his
types turn out so typical. But it seemed to him they
overdid it. He had not really supposed that Susannah
was so bad as that. It verged on the scandalous.
Unless—but it could mean only one thing.</p>

<p>Matters, however, proved not to be so simple,
after all. There came a day when the Elder entered
the studio in a state of mind more perturbed than
any he had yet betrayed.</p>

<p>“She has refused me,” he called out. “What do
you think of that?”</p>

<p>The Younger did not know what to think of it.
While, on the one hand, he could not restrain a certain
gratification at Susannah’s discernment, he
deprecated, on the other, her amazing course with
regard to the presents. But the Elder left him no
time to muse.</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose she said?” he continued
excitedly. “She said she wasn’t sure how much I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
really cared for her. How much! She holds out her
hand for everything I bring and then she agreeably
withdraws it when she sees nothing more. After I
have made myself the talk of the town!”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what I told you,” remarked the
Younger, who was much at sea. “Did you expect
to bribe her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you told me. And I know
what to think of such people.”</p>

<p>The Younger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If that is the way you take it, I begin to think
Susannah is right.”</p>

<p>The Elder threw him a look.</p>

<p>“But what does she want?” he cried, clasping his
hands dramatically in the air. “What does she want
that I can’t give her? What is she now, compared
to what she would be as my wife?”</p>

<p>The Younger examined his finger nails.</p>

<p>“You have already had some opportunity to learn
that an American girl is the most unfettered creature
in the universe. She may think it more amusing to
stay so than to become an Italian marchioness.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said they were respectable—your
famous <i>jeunes filles</i>,” exclaimed the Elder sarcastically.</p>

<p>The Younger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“At any rate she won’t stay <i>jeune</i> forever. And
what is she now, compared to what she would become?
She is nobody, whereas my wife——” A
handsome gesture left the Younger to figure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
personage. “Then she evidently finds the attractions
of this country superior to the rather problematical
ones—if you will pardon me!—of her own.
She says every day she is going, but she never
goes.”</p>

<p>“Well, she is at least free to go. And you must
remember that America is gilded with the associations
of an unbitted youth. There is but an open
door between her and an iridescent dream. When
Europe has no more to offer her champing spirit she
has but to step back into that happy hunting-ground
of the <i>jeune fille</i>. Whereas with you—the door would
close behind her.”</p>

<p>The Elder put this from him with a twist of head
and hand. “Excuse me, <i>caro mio</i>, if I seem to allude
to personal matters. But you will remember that
at Viareggio, that first time, you attributed something
of your own coolness to—to the fact——”</p>

<p>“Of being a pauper?” filled out the Younger cheerfully.
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I must say it, she could do much worse
than to marry me. Doesn’t she know?”</p>

<p>“That is true,” admitted the Younger, studying
his nails anew. From another these facts somehow
came with less grace. So he contented himself with
adding: “But she might also do better.”</p>

<p>“How?” interrogated the Elder, turning savagely
upon him. “What more, I ask you, can a respectable
girl want? In God’s name, what more?”</p>

<p>The Younger suddenly knew that he approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
enough of Susannah’s discernment to suspend judgment
upon her bad taste.</p>

<p>“Perhaps what you call ‘respectability,’ for one
thing,” he suggested. “And for another——” He
pulled up. “Yet she has that already. So why
should she want it?”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded the Elder. “I will give her
whatever she wants. What is it?”</p>

<p>The way in which he shouted it made the Younger
look out of the window.</p>

<p>“Youth,” he replied.</p>

<p>There was a silence. There was such a silence that
the Younger knew he had been a fool. He turned
around with the intention of smoothing things over
a bit, and the look which he caught on the Elder’s
face deepened his pang.</p>

<p>But the marquis, giving him no time, passed it off.</p>

<p>“Eh, my young friend, you have hit it on the head.
But never mind. I have not made myself the talk
of the town for nothing. And Miss Susannah shall
find it out. I will go on as I have begun. I will pay
her such attention, I will give her such presents, that
even she—even she—will find that she is compromised.
Then I will tell you whom she will marry.”</p>

<p>And with this delicate intimation he stalked away.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>This was how it came to the Younger that more
might lie in experiments than one foresaw. He did
not like at all that insinuation that the marquis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
would catch Susannah by foul means if not by fair.
But, however he might dislike the Elder’s tactics,
the Younger felt his own share of the responsibility.</p>

<p>The two men met one morning at the gate of the
<i>villino</i>—the Younger going in, the Elder coming out.
They exchanged ceremonious salutations, as usual.</p>

<p>“I have just brought the knockers,” said the latter.
“I am much obliged for that clever suggestion
of yours. The head is a speaking likeness.”</p>

<p>The Younger smiled uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Yes? And what does our young lady think of
them?”</p>

<p>“She is very pretty. She says they are too charming
to put out here on the door. She must keep them
by her.”</p>

<p>The Younger stepped inside and slammed the gate
in the other’s face. Could a spectator then have
seen both sides of the wall he would have observed
each gentleman, very red, contemplating for a moment
the closed door. He would finally have beheld
them turn and walk away—the Elder slowly, shrugging
his shoulders; the Younger in haste, his head held
high.</p>

<p>He found Susannah in the <i>sala</i>, laughing over the
obnoxious knockers. The sight of it angered him the
more.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” he cried out, “you have
made a fool of yourself long enough. You must go
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>Susannah stopped laughing, for very surprise. She
examined the flushed Younger curiously, as if he had
been a strange beast in a cage.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “what is the matter with you?
Do you feel ill? Shall I ring for Gilda?”</p>

<p>The Younger flung his hat into a chair.</p>

<p>“I do feel ill! You and the marquis make me ill
between you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, the marquis!” Susannah glanced at the
knockers and smiled. “Yes, I remember. You introduced
the marquis to me. Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he snapped. “That’s why I’m here now.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“What funny creatures men are! They never
think of things beforehand. And they said you were
clever.”</p>

<p>“I never told you so,” he retorted rather dully.
“You’d better wait till you get things from headquarters.”</p>

<p>“So had you,” she rapped out. “Who told you, I
was making a fool of myself?”</p>

<p>“Nobody! Nobody needed to! What under the
sun do you mean by filling your house with his
truck?”</p>

<p>“What business is it of yours?” demanded Susannah
hotly. “You don’t care anything about us!”</p>

<p>“What if I don’t? I care about seeing my country
made a scandal.”</p>

<p>Susannah again looked at him curiously a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“O! If you are so patriotic I wonder you don’t go
home yourself. Wouldn’t that be the easiest way
out of your—” she smiled—“your troubles?”</p>

<p>“No! That wouldn’t stop anything. I want
things stopped. I want you to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” she exclaimed. “You <i>are</i> in a hurry
all of a sudden. It seems to me that you ask a good
deal of people you have done so little for—though
perhaps you have done a good deal. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“No!” he cried. “Since you ask, I want you to
send him back all these things—every single one of
them.”</p>

<p>She looked at him more curiously still.</p>

<p>“What! All these pretty things! Why, we’re only
just beginning to get comfortable. And see! He just
brought me something else.”</p>

<p>She held up the knockers, as if they had been two
dolls. The Younger shrugged his shoulders and
walked to the end of the room.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he suddenly threw
at her. “Are you going to marry him?”</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Him? O no! No! And I don’t even think he
really wants me to. It’s a sort of game, you see,”
she added, with a confiding seriousness.</p>

<p>“<i>Dio mio!</i> I do see. I have seen for a good while.
How long are you going to keep it up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you really deserve to know,” she
said, with her head on one side. “But since you ask,
and since you began it, I will tell you.” She assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
an air of great mystery. “I’m going to keep it up
till he brings me the gold salt cellars!”</p>

<p>He stared at her. But she faced him out. And
when he walked away to a window she threw him a
question in turn.</p>

<p>“Now that I’ve told you what you wanted to
know, will you tell me something?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” He faced partly about.</p>

<p>“Just how did the game begin? What did you
tell him, I mean? You see, his—his manners—were
so different before you came and after.”</p>

<p>The Younger laughed curtly.</p>

<p>“I told him you were respectable.”</p>

<p>At this he looked out of the window again.</p>

<p>“Oh—respectable,” said Susannah behind him.
“You told him I was respectable? That was very
kind of you—I’m sure.” And then the Eternal
Feminine came out with a sob. “You horrid man!
You perfectly horrid man! You’re just——”</p>

<p>She flounced out of the room.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The Elder stood at the gate of the <i>villino</i>. It was
a post familiar enough to him, and the particular object
upon which his eyes rested was scarcely less so.
But the juxtaposition was unusual. For the panel
before him was embellished by that replica of Benvenuto’s
knocker, to which reference has already so
frequently been made. What manner of omen could
it be? He studied the knocker. He studied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
door. And finally it occurred to him to apply the
one with some vehemence to the other.</p>

<p>In response to this overture a flip-flap of slippers
clattered across the flagging within, and the door
was opened by Gilda in person. Again the Elder
wondered. For hitherto the door, obeying some secret
impulse, had betrayed no hint of human agency.
The maid, however, left him no time to parley:</p>

<p>“<i>O signor marchese!</i> The ladies have gone to America.
Did he forget?”</p>

<p>“<i>Diavolo!</i>” ejaculated that personage.</p>

<p>“Yes, about a quarter of an hour ago. They said
they told him they were going, but in case he forgot
and came again—the <i>marchese</i> has made such a
habit!—to let him know they were leaving by the
Genoa train, at eleven. There is still time.”</p>

<p>The Elder looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Is there still time?” he uttered slowly. He stared
at the sea god who so splendidly brandished in his
own image the trident before his eyes.</p>

<p>“If the <i>marchese</i> hastens,” replied the interested
Gilda. “My <i>padrona</i>——”</p>

<p>But the Elder quenched her with a silver <i>lira</i> and
strode away. Even after he had ordered a cabman
to hurry him to the station, though, he did not really
believe he would go in. Indeed, by the time he
reached the station he was quite sure he would not
go in. That would be too——Yet he jumped out of
the carriage before it stopped, and ran through to
the platform. He would just find out! And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
charged into the arms of the Younger, who was
strolling up and down with a cigarette.</p>

<p>“It is true, eh?” asked the Elder, collecting himself
against this new surprise. For the moment it
escaped him that he and the Younger were no longer
on the best of terms.</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” replied the other. “Shall I take
you to the compartment?”</p>

<p>The Elder did not answer. But he followed his
companion, replacing his monocle on the way; and
presently, in all truth, he beheld Susannah and The
General enthroned amid mountains of luggage.</p>

<p>“Why, we began to think you weren’t coming!”
cried Susannah, smiling out of the window. “That
would have been a nice way to treat us!”</p>

<p>The Elder made an extravagant bow.</p>

<p>“If you give no hint——”</p>

<p>Susannah laughed. “No one ever got so many
hints. We have told you every day. We told you
yesterday.”</p>

<p>The Elder passed it off with a shrug.</p>

<p>“How soon may we expect you back?”</p>

<p>Susannah shook her finger out of the window.</p>

<p>“Never! We are through with Europe.”</p>

<p>“O!” The marquis laughed. “And how about
America?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Susannah. “There’s no comparison!”</p>

<p>“So I have understood!” exclaimed the Elder
gaily, glancing at the Younger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think you understand well enough,
though,” objected Susannah. “You don’t seem to
understand that, after all, people make more difference
than things. And the people there are different.
It isn’t just that they don’t act like monkeys
the first time they see you on the beach. It isn’t
that they aren’t taken in so easily, and that they
don’t make such fools of themselves. They are
nicer. They are kinder. They have some decency
and some self-respect.”</p>

<p>She quite lost her climaxes in her haste to get it
out, and in her smile there was something very
pointed.</p>

<p>As for the marquis, he again made a profound
bow.</p>

<p>“They are very superior beings, I am sure. But
you seem to have been some time in coming to this
conclusion.”</p>

<p>Susannah’s head dropped a little to one side.</p>

<p>“Not so long as you might think,” she said. “I
reached it at Viareggio, last summer.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the marquis. “And may
one ask how, with such a weight upon your mind,
you succeeded in deferring your departure so long?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes! And what is more, I will tell you. I
was waiting to furnish the <i>villino</i>. It wasn’t quite
complete, you know, until the other day. Did I tell
you,” she asked, turning to the Younger, “that the
marquis had given me the loveliest little gold salt
cellars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Your furniture will be much admired in your
American home,” remarked the Elder pleasantly.</p>

<p>“O dear no!” cried Susannah. “I wouldn’t have
anything in my American home to remind me of
Europe. We have left the <i>villino</i>, just as it stands, to
the new tenant.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You must have got something very handsome
for so completely equipped an establishment—even
to gold salt cellars,” exclaimed the Elder, with
an amiable smile.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might have,” replied Susannah; “but
the new tenant could scarcely have afforded that.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask who the happy man may be?”
inquired the Elder, with perhaps a shade of interest.</p>

<p>“O, it isn’t a man at all,” said Susannah. “It’s
our maid, you know—Gilda. She has been so good—the
one good person in Europe, I believe. We
bought the house for her, and took the trouble to
have a complete inventory put in the deed—down to
the door-knockers—so that there might be no misunderstanding
about it.”</p>

<p>Whatever the Elder might have had for that was
spoiled by the guard, who hurried toward them,
locking the compartment doors. Turning to the
Younger the Elder took his arm.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “it seems to me that we are forsaken!”</p>

<p>He was admirable. He had never been so admirable.
The Younger, however, gently disengaged
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Pardon me. I am sorry to seem rude, but—I am
going, too.”</p>

<p>And he made for the door before the guard should
lock it.</p>

<p>“<i>Par-ten-za!</i>” shouted that functionary, with energy.</p>

<p>The two young people stood together at the window,
looking down at the Elder. For an instant the
Younger’s heart smote him. But something from
the eyes nearer his own hardened him again to the
cruelty of youth.</p>

<p>“O, by the way,” he called, as the train jolted
into motion: “Don’t forget! You owe me, you
know, a thousand francs!”</p>

<p>“O you cynical man!” cried the lady from
Pittsburgh. She had wattles, and a jewelled
lorgnette through which she made me aware
of the disadvantage under which we suffered in that
day and generation who went about the world without
shoulder-straps. She leaned forward a little in order
to obtain a better view of those worn by Mrs. Maturin’s
General.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” I protested. “Do you think me as
young as that? A cynic is a doggish person, who
snarls. Now I may be a dog, but at bottom I am as
sentimental as a school-girl. At the same time I
can’t help noticing that people are very seldom of
one piece. And I understand them better if I put
together, or take apart, the different pieces. Besides,
what people do is not often important. What
may be important are their reasons for doing it.
Don’t you think?”</p>

<p>She didn’t. A waiter, bearing away her oyster
shells, widened the breach between us. Across it the
lady from Pittsburgh confided to me that her husband,
also without shoulder-straps, who sat at the
left of our hostess, was in his quiet way working for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Uncle Sam. I asked myself if her phrase did not
perhaps contain an unnecessary preposition. For
although half an hour before I had never heard of
her, I had heard of him. He was one of those gentlemen
so plentiful in Washington just then, full of
good advice for the Government, and a little uneasy
lest their particular good thing be looked into by
some inquisitive commission. What his particular
thing was I am too discreet to mention; but it was
good enough to keep his wife’s wattles in the pink,
not to say the purple, of condition, and to set them
off by a quite rococo display of diamonds. They
confirmed me anew in an old persuasion of mine that
a diamond is a stone for a chambermaid—and not for
those rare members of that oppressed profession who
are as good as gold.</p>

<p>I should say for the lady from Pittsburgh that this
reflection probably came to me because fate, generally
readier with a surprise than with a piece of good
fortune, had put at my other side the famous Miss
Sanderson—or the famous Mrs. Maturin, as she is
now. She had in her hair some of those perfect
emeralds which are the only jewels she ever wears.
She explains that she has to, because she was born
in May and because a romantic parent took it into
his head to name her Esmeralda. Her explanation
would be less convincing if the same individual had
not bequeathed her a <i>dot</i> as melodramatic as her
name. Who bequeathed her that aureole of smouldering
bronze hair—of the kind you read about in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
short-story magazines, but never see—it is not for
me to say. In such cases one usually suspects the
beauty doctor. But no beauty doctor could achieve
that ivory skin, or those grey-green eyes which—Well,
they were so much more lyric than I remembered
that I myself could almost break out in the
most approved magazine manner about moonlit
pools in mountain forests, etc. So if the lady from
Pittsburgh considered me an ill-natured dog, I counted
myself a lucky one, after all. Not that Mrs. Maturin
is witty, or rich in recondite stores of gossip.
But then, she needs no such adventitious attractions.
She has only to enter a room to have all eyes
rest upon her with the tranquil pleasure that is given,
say, by an orchid in an old silver-gilt vase.</p>

<p>In furtively giving myself that pleasure, amid the
chatter about food conservation which went on above
a delicious terrapin soup, it amused me to recall the
last time I had seen Mrs. Maturin, there on the
other side of the world—Miss Sanderson as she was
then. Whereupon she suddenly paid me the compliment
of turning away from her General long enough
to say in a low voice:</p>

<p>“I got it, you know. I’ll tell you about it when I
get a chance. I haven’t forgotten that I really owe
it to you. And it gave me Peter.”</p>

<p>At the moment I was dull enough to wonder what
she meant. For I had imagined that her fortune
had given her Peter. But as she turned back to the
General she bent forward a little toward Peter, across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the table, and I saw his eyes light up as they looked
for hers. It was pretty to see, at that table where
diamonds lit up double chins and pouched eyes
from which all fire had long since faded. And no
fortune could have bought that. It simply is not
in the market.</p>

<p>Even as I told myself so, however, Peter’s expression
changed so abruptly, as he caught me looking
at him, with so little of pride and triumph in his eye,
that I could not help asking myself if I had misread
his radio message. Was it conceivable that any
dramatic complication of the human comedy could
lie in wait among the lights and flowers of so polite
a dinner-party? At any rate, nothing but an S. O.
S. could have the passion of Peter’s look, if it were
not such a look as I first fancied. Yet why on earth
should Peter be going down with all on board—now,
at our comfortable Shoreham, in our safe Washington,
before the lovely eyes of his well-dowered Esmeralda?
And if by any chance he was, what could
she do to save him?</p>

<p>I paid for these untimely and fantastic ruminations
by finding that the lorgnette of the lady from
Pittsburgh was no longer turned in my direction. It
now glittered upon young Rodman of the Intelligence
Service, at her right, who had been the means of her
making that ever delightful discovery with regard to
the smallness of the world. At my left Beauty and
Valour were already deep in the war. As for myself,
whom fate has seen fit to withhold from the paths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
glory, and upon whom two great ladies now turned a
sufficiently unflattering pair of backs, I was not too
piqued to be grateful for a moment in which to turn
over the case of Peter and Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Maturin was right. I suppose I had,
after all, given her Peter. At any rate, I had accidentally
set in motion the series of events that ended
in so eugenic a marriage. I have lived long enough,
however, to learn that it is never safe to say where a
series of events has ended. And knowing Peter far
far better than I knew his wife, I could not help wondering
whether the condition of equilibrium which
had been arrived at were a stable one. Still, there
had been that look across the table. And larger fortunes
than Mrs. Maturin’s have been spent on objects
less worthy than Peter. He was young: I
fancy a little younger than his Esmeralda. He was
tall and well made. He was very nearly as good-looking
in his way as she was in hers. He was no
fool, either. He could ride, he could shoot, he could
play every imaginable game—though somehow he
could never carry off the stakes. And he was enough
of an engineer, or a mineralogist, or whatever an oil-man
needs to be, for an English company to send him
out to Persia, of all places, to tap rocks and drill
holes for their dark operations. The only thing
was—Well, I wondered whether he would prove
completely satisfactory as a husband. But then,
perhaps it is not the truly good young man who is
most adored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Peter, when I met him in Tehran, seemed by no
means one of the truly good. I do not say it in disparagement;
for I have noticed, in this ironic world,
that the truly good seem as capable of making a
botch of their own and other people’s lives as the
rest of us, while the prodigal son appears to enjoy an
undue share of immortality. Be that as it may, the
sight of Peter across the table, chatting with the
Honourable Miss Windham, brought it incongruously
back to me that the first time I ever saw him was
much later in the evening than this, between the
shafts of a pre-historic victoria which he, together
with a young Russian attaché and a couple of youths
whom I took to be Telegraph, was trundling down
the Lalazar, as it were the Pennsylvania Avenue of
Tehran, with every sign of enjoyment. Who was in
the victoria I don’t know. Certainly not Mrs. Maturin,
then.</p>

<p>I afterward heard—in those places, you know, one
hears everything about everybody—that although
theoretically prospecting for oil among the mountains
of Kurdistan, he was for the moment <i>persona
non grata</i> in that temperamental land, where his investigations
had included the wearers of veils. However,
he was distinctly <i>persona grata</i> with M. Godet,
the French hotel-keeper, who does so much for the
local colour of Tehran. While there are a good many
young men there, what with the Legations, the
Bank, the Telegraph, and what not, and while between
one estate and another are there great gulfs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
fixed, in the most approved metropolitan manner,
the young men vastly outnumber the young women
of their own sort or of any other sort, for that matter.
And there are fewer things for them to do than
in larger and less exotic capitals. They therefore
give themselves with the more zest to such simple
distractions as may be found in any mining-camp.
And one of their favourite distractions is to sack M.
Godet’s hotel. M. Godet takes these periodical devastations
very philosophically. I suspect, in fact,
that he rather counts on them—in a country where
travellers are rare and of the less pecunious, if of the
more adventurous, sort, such as military men, rug-buyers,
missionaries, and music-hall artists. As for
the young men, certain among them are mortgaged
to M. Godet for life. It is quite a recognised institution
of Tehran. The Legation, or the Bank, or the
Telegraph, goes bond for its particular young man,
and he goes without everything but pilau enough to
keep him at his desk until he is square with M.
Godet. Peter, being an outsider, might have fared
more hardly if I had not been foolish enough, as a fellow-countryman,
to sign my name to a certain scrap
of paper drawn up between him and M. Godet. True,
the wisdom of my folly had very soon been proved
by the tearing up of that scrap of paper, not long
after Peter’s departure, by M. Godet himself. But
the transaction enlightened me not a little on such
topics as the budget of the Hôtel de Paris, the price
of glass in Persia, etc. For Peter, they said, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
he became a little exalted, cried out for air, and he
never could wait to open the windows. He preferred
to pitch the furniture at them. He never killed any
body who happened to be passing below.</p>

<p>So you see there were reasons for my liking Peter.
There was something honest and human about him.
We all have impulses to throw furniture, but not
many of us have the courage of our convictions.
Still, I had never dreamed that Peter would turn out
so much the hero of a fairy-tale as to marry the miraculous
Miss Sanderson. She turned up in Tehran,
too, a year or two after the war broke out, with a
French maid and a mongrel Caucasian courier. The
war had caught her in Vladikavkaz, Kisliavodsk,
one of those watering-places in the Caucasus. She
had stayed on in Russia, waiting for the war to stop,
till she made up her mind that the longest way
around was the shortest way home. And she sailed
into the Legation one day, with a letter from the
Embassy at Petrograd, desiring to be presented at
court and to be shown the Peacock Throne.</p>

<p>It is hard to deny the requests of beautiful ladies.
The requests of Miss Sanderson were peculiarly impossible,
because, in the first place, ladies are not
presented at court in Persia, as they are in more
modern monarchies, and because, in the second place,
there happens to be no Peacock Throne. There was
one once, with a history as wonderful as its canopy
of jewelled peacocks, of which there remains nothing
but a doubtful modern fragment. And there is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
another, whose name refers not to its decoration,
but to a certain Madam Peacock who adorned the
harem of Fat’h Ali Shah. These facts were set forth
at considerable length, many years ago, in his
important work on Persia, by Lord Curzon of Kedleston.
But if every other traveller always demanded
a sight of the Peacock Throne, and always went
away doubting our account of the matter, how could
eyes so romantic as those of Miss Sanderson be expected
to waste themselves on the closely printed
and none too thrilling pages of an ex-Viceroy of
India? So I contented myself by pointing out
to Miss Sanderson that the Peacock Throne had
not been visible since the coronation of young
Ahmed Shah, and that Tehran was full of dark
rumours as to its having been sold, together with
many other magnificent things belonging to the
Persian crown. In the third place, however, the
requests of the lovely Esmeralda were in particular
impossible because of the moment which she chose
for making them. It was the moment when the
rivers of German gold poured out in Persia had
begun to produce their effect. The Holy War had
been preached, the banks in the south had been
looted, the gendarmes had gone over to the enemy
after their Swedish officers, the battle of Kengaver
had been fought, and Kermanshah and Hamadan
had been taken by the Turks. Even in Tehran things
were beginning to look very funny. I therefore urged
Miss Sanderson to return to Russia while she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
and get home via Sweden or Siberia. As for going
to India by way of the Gulf, it was out of the question.</p>

<p>All the same, she did it! Impossible, I suppose, is
a word not to be found in the dictionaries of lovely
ladies who all their lives have seen the most obdurate
doors fly open before them. And this lovely lady
evidently had her share of the resolution, or of a certain
indifference to the realities of life, for which her
sex is noted. Not that she took anybody into her
confidence—except Peter. Him she also took with
her, to the vast amusement of Tehran, for whom the
fantasies of the American virgin upon her travels
are still more or less a novelty. The gossip was that
she had discharged her courier and taken Peter on
instead. Everybody knew that poor Peter was hard
up. At any rate, I happened to know that he and
Miss Sanderson had never heard of each other until
I introduced them, shortly before they disappeared.
And that introduction was merely an accident.
On such careless threads do hang the destinies
of men!</p>

<p>As I considered it, eyeing the correct and opulent
Peter, who now looked secure against the accidents
of life, I had to scratch my head to recall just how
we had turned so successful a trick, Providence and
I. Oh, yes: an emerald, of course. Miss Sanderson
had not taken me very seriously at first, and had gone
over my head to the Chief and then to the Russians.
She had letters to them, too. But a few days later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
when I ran across her at the French Legation, she
said she had about made up her mind to take my advice.
Persia was too disappointing, what with the
dirt and the ugliness and the discomfort and the
obstacles everybody put in the way of her seeing the
sights, if there really were any. She had even been
unable to find anything in the Bazaar.</p>

<p>I explained to her that in Persia nobody goes shopping
in bazaars, if antiques were what she was after.
The only thing was to get hold of a go-between, a
sort of broker who has ways of getting into Persian
houses and of getting out the treasures some of them
contain.</p>

<p>“Then find me one,” she promptly recommended.</p>

<p>It appeared that she didn’t want rugs or tiles or
miniatures or any of the other things that most people
take from Persia. She wanted an emerald, and
a much better one than she had seen in the shops.
It was then that I first heard of her fancy for emeralds.
She had one that belonged to Marie Antoinette.
She had another that came from the magnificent
collection of Abd-ül-Hamid. Why shouldn’t she
have a third out of the treasury in Tehran—if the
Shah’s jewels were really being sold? If I wouldn’t
show her the Peacock Throne, I might at least get
her a go-between. The notion seemed to tickle her
enormously, and she refused to be frightened by my
warnings that she would have to keep her eyes very
wide open and pay any number of commissions without
knowing it, including a good fat one for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>So it was that I handed her over to Peter. Not
that Peter was the go-between. The go-between
was a picturesque character known in Tehran as the
Adorner of the Monarchy. The Adorner of the
Monarchy, otherwise one Yeprem Khan, is really an
Armenian, I believe. Just how he came to merit his
flowery Persian title I cannot say—unless by virtue of
his decorative beard, which he dyes purple with
henna. Or perhaps it is because out of his back shop
in Tiflis, which is his true headquarters, come most
of the Rhages jars which adorn the collections of
Europe and America. At any rate, the Adorner of
the Monarchy is one of the greatest artists and most
unmitigated rascals in Asia. There is very little in
the way of Saracenic antiquities which the old scarecrow
cannot turn out of that mysterious back shop
of his in Tiflis, though he specialises in pre-Sefevian
pottery. The only trouble with it is that some of it
is genuine. For in that sort of thing the Adorner of
the Monarchy has the scent of a bloodhound. And
he sticks that sanguine beard of his into every corner
of western Asia where there may be battle,
revolution, or sudden death, seeking what he may
devour. Wherefore, I suppose, did he happen to be
there in Tehran when we wanted him.</p>

<p>Of course if it had been something really nice Miss
Sanderson was after, like an eleventh-century bowl
or a miniature by Behzad, she would have been a
lost woman. As it was, she knew a good deal more
about emeralds than the Adorner of the Monarchy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
I could as easily have conceived him taking an interest
in Mission furniture. The point was that those
clairvoyant eyes of his, as black and deep as Avernus,
yet humourously three-cornered, could find anything
for anybody. They even say he was the one who
found that French countess for Prince Salar-es-Somebody.
However, for extra precaution I called in
Peter. There were half a dozen obvious enough reasons
why he was a better man for Miss Sanderson’s
affair than I, the most important being that I had
something else to think about just then than trinkets
for beautiful ladies. Things had already been looking
rather funny behind the scenes in Tehran. They
got funnier until that day when the fat little Shah
was stopped in the nick of time from running away
to Isfahan and the Germans. His valuables had
gone, his bodyguard had gone, he himself was on the
point of going, when the British and Russian ministers
demanded even more insistently than Miss Sanderson
an audience with him. Precisely what they
said to him has yet to be published, though we got
a fairly reliable version of it before night. But the
Shah did not go to Isfahan.</p>

<p>Peter and Miss Sanderson did, however. The first
definite news we had of them was from there, in a
note of Peter’s that came through as soon as the Russians
had cleared the road. Not that the note
brought any real news. It merely contained an inclosure
for M. Godet and laconic thanks for my own
part in that affair. Nor did we hear anything more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
about our enterprising pair before I had to leave
Tehran myself. And here I had run into them again,
alive and married, in Washington! It was a common
enough whirligig of life, but I was simple enough to
be amused by it. I wished that blessed General
would hurry up with his National Army. In the
meantime I speculated as to which of Mrs. Maturin’s
emeralds was the Persian one. That, of course,
must have been what she meant she owed me. What
interested me more, though, was how they had
managed to get through the Turkish lines, and how
long it had taken them to get married. They must
have had adventures, those two.</p>

<p>If life were like stories, Esmeralda would at this
point have turned back to me and have taken up her
part in these reminiscences, or I would have prepared
for it by shouting across the table at Peter. But
both these young people were otherwise occupied,
while the lady from Pittsburgh continued to be engrossed
in Rodman and his aunts. I therefore plied
my fork in undistinguished silence, outwardly trying
to look intelligent and inwardly comparing the
Shoreham with the Hôtel de Paris. If one was rather
better appointed and the other a little livelier, it
would be hard to say which of the two could collect
queerer fish out of the seven seas. Washington and
Tehran, for that matter, are a good deal alike. Neither
quite looks its part, and in both there is a great
deal more news than ever comes out in any paper.
I would not swear, either, that it is more reliable or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
less fantastic in one capital than in the other. What
I found most fantastic, though, was that I, whose
own affairs are far from glittering, should turn out to
be a sort of Harun-ar-Rashid, carelessly presenting
a capricious lady with the jewel of her heart’s desire
and an unfortunate gentleman with a fortune and a
wife. As I considered it I began to feel the pride of
the creator in his handiwork. After all, Providence
needs a poke now and then. Even Mr. Belasco:
would he do as well for us in that new play to which
we were going after dinner? Which for some obscure
reason reminded me of my newly married cousin
Millicent, who didn’t want her cook to make friends
with the cook next door because the people in that
house were Presbyterians. And so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Dessert was in sight before the General finished
what he had to say about the improvisation of the
Air Service, whose deficiencies I hope he overstated.
He then pronounced highly enlightening and worthy
of being brought to the attention of the M. I. D.
Mrs. Maturin’s report of the military preparations
of India and Japan—as observed from the port-holes
of ocean greyhounds, the windows of first-class compartments,
and the lobbies of the best hotels. And
at last Mrs. Maturin turned to me.</p>

<p>“But where is it?” I demanded, beginning with
what interested me least. “Which one is it?”</p>

<p>It was her turn to be mystified, having been occupied
with affairs of state while I was mooning about
her and Peter. But, noticing that my eyes were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the points of green light in her bronze hair, she came
around quickly enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t there. It’s—it’s quite a story,” she
broke off. I was ready to believe her. But dessert
was already on, and I hadn’t waited all that time to
hear the threadbare old yarn of bargaining in Asia.
“The funny part of it,” Mrs. Maturin went on, “is
that I saw the Peacock Throne after all—thanks to
you.” She leaned toward me as if to confide the
most delightful of secrets. “That’s where I got my
emerald.”</p>

<p>If jaws could drop, mine would have crashed into
my plate. My partnership with Providence had
gone rather farther than I foresaw if it had been the
means of providing the lovely Esmeralda not only
with a historic precious stone, but with one from a
piece of furniture which does not exist. I began to feel
vaguely uneasy. I remembered what in my pride of
a Harun-ar-Rashid I had almost forgotten, that look
of Peter’s across the table. And so many questions
suddenly surged up into the back of my head that I
again asked the one which interested me least.</p>

<p>“How soon did you young people make up your
minds to get married? In Tehran?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no! It wasn’t till we got to India. And
then we were driven into it. People kept making
the most stupid mistakes—insisting on giving us the
same room, and all that sort of thing. Of course it was
a mad thing to do, to trail off like that with a man I
had never seen or heard of the week before. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
was just wild to get that emerald. And Peter was
such a sport—not like the rest of you old fogies in
Tehran. And then out there in Persia, in sight of
the war, things didn’t look just as they would here.
We had no end of a time, you know. I wondered afterward
that I ever had the courage to go through
with it. But,” she added irrelevantly, “if it hadn’t
been for that, I would have gone straight to Paris
and cut Pierre Loti’s throat!”</p>

<p>“O! la! la!” I let out, marvelling that a Mrs.
Maturin should hold an unorthodox literary opinion.
“Why his?” There are so many other throats that
need cutting first.</p>

<p>“Well, he is such an awful liar. I don’t know why
it is that people who write books give you such false
impressions. They always lead you to expect so
much colour and magnificence in the East, when it
is mostly dirt and fleas—or worse.”</p>

<p>It was curious that a lady capable of discovering
Kisliavodsk, and of running away with a strange
man into the jaws of the Germans, should be incapable
of seeing Persia through her own eyes. I might
have pointed out to her that if the readers of books
have made up their minds what a country ought to be
like, the most candid writers of books have small
chance against them, and that a Pierre Loti will
make admirable prose out of the most unpromising
material. But what I wanted to point out to her was
that books at least get on with their stories faster
than she was doing. Instead of which I remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“The Adorner of the Monarchy is quite a character,
isn’t he? He must have worked the oracle very
quickly, for you to have scuttled off from Tehran as
soon as you did.”</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>“He didn’t work it in Tehran. He worked it in
Kum. That, really, was how Peter happened to go
with us. My courier refused to when he heard about
that little rumpus the Turks were stirring up.”</p>

<p>“Kum!” I cried. “Why Kum, of all earthly
places? I never heard of anybody going to Kum
except on a pilgrimage to that shrine.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what we did.”</p>

<p>I stared at her, for that shrine is one of the most
sacred spots in Persia. It is the last resting-place of
Fatima the Immaculate, granddaughter I don’t remember
how many times great of the Prophet, and
sister of the Imam Riza—who flies over once a week
from his own more famous tomb in Meshed to visit
her. And few there are, of Christian birth, that is,
who have seen it.</p>

<p>“You look as if you didn’t believe me,” said Mrs.
Maturin. “But it was simple enough. Don’t you
remember how the Shah tried to run away to Isfahan,
and how he sent his things on ahead of him?
Well, when he didn’t turn up, they put the things
into the shrine at Kum for safe keeping. The Adorner
of the Monarchy happened to know about it.
And you were quite right about the Shah’s being
willing to sell some of his jewels. That was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
how we happened to go to Kum. Have you been
there?”</p>

<p>I had to tell her that having spent three years
within walking distance, so to speak, of it, I had
never visited it.</p>

<p>“I had never even heard of it,” she was frank
enough to confess. “But it was more like Persia
than anything else I saw. We had to go in disguise,
you know. I was supposed to be the wife of the
Adorner of the Monarchy, and Peter and Claudine
were our servants! It was immense fun. But that
costume is horribly stuffy, I assure you. And I
couldn’t half see anything through that little strip
of openwork in front of my eyes.”</p>

<p>She almost left me speechless.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I allowed myself to suggest, “that was
why you liked it so much.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” she was again human
enough to admit. “But there’s really a lot of colour
there, besides those usual horrid mud houses and flat
roofs. Miles before we got there we could see the
dome of Fatima’s tomb glittering like a great gold
bubble above the plain, with iridescent mountains
behind it. And as we got nearer we made out the big
turquoise minarets around it, and smaller domes of
peacock tiles, and little blue-and-green tiled pinnacles,
above cream-coloured walls. You have no idea
how attractive it was.”</p>

<p>That, I must confess, would ordinarily have been
enough to quench my interest. When beautiful ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
call a place attractive, the game, so far as I am
concerned, is up. But this was a different game.</p>

<p>“Did you really go into the shrine itself?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course we did. We had to, to carry out the
comedy. And I didn’t know what it didn’t cost us.
They were dreadfully afraid we would betray ourselves
and get them into trouble. They whisked us
out in no time. I got only the vaguest impression,
through my strip of open-work, of a dim-lighted octagon,
and a catafalque covered with cloth of gold
behind a tall silver grille. But it was worth it.”</p>

<p>I was grateful to them, whoever they were, for delaying
me no longer than necessary. It came to me
a little enviously, though, that beauty and gold are
indeed magic keys. Also that dessert was disappearing
all too rapidly. Likewise that the lady from
Pittsburgh was eyeing Mrs. Maturin through her
lorgnette.</p>

<p>“Then they took us,” the latter went on, “through
a porcelain gateway into the loveliest little cloister I
ever saw—all blue and green tiles, with a toy river
running through it, in a channel of mossy marble
that widened in the centre into a big oblong pool.
Some enormous cypress-trees were reflected in it.”</p>

<p>I thought it must have been very becoming to her.
But I was too afraid of wasting time to tell her so.</p>

<p>“I hoped they would empty the pool and let us
into a secret passage at the bottom of it, or something
like that. But they took us through a high
tiled porch at one end of the court, into a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
apartment where the Shah stays when he makes
pilgrimages to the shrine—all plaster arabesques,
stuck over in the quaintest way with bits of mirror
glass.”</p>

<p>“Was it there?” I asked desperately, perceiving
signs of coffee.</p>

<p>“Not in the room where we sat down. There was
nothing but rugs and couches. They served us tea
and candies and ices, and they talked about the
weather, and asked how many children Peter and I
had. They were frightfully embarrassing. And at
last, one at a time, they began showing us things
that the Shah had sent there and wanted to sell.”</p>

<p>“Fancy!” I heard from my right.</p>

<p>“Some of them were quite nice,” said Mrs. Maturin.
“There were one or two big carpets, and a
few of those funny old books full of gaudy little pictures
that look like nothing on earth, touched up
with gold. Pottery, too. The usual bazaar kind of
thing, only better of its kind than usual. Then they
showed us jewels—bowls of them! They were nothing
very extraordinary, though: mostly rubies and
pearls. I didn’t have my veil down, either,” she
added. “They let me put it off, in there. But I
wouldn’t let them put me off, even when they
brought out two or three good enough emeralds.
The Adorner of the Monarchy—isn’t he killing!—had
got us permission to see the Peacock Throne, and
I insisted that they must let us see it. So at last,
very unwillingly, they took us into an inner room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
It was full of boxes and bundles, piled helter-skelter
on top of one another. They cleared off some of
them till they came to an enormous case, which they
opened with the most ridiculous little adzes you ever
saw. And out of it they pulled a mountain of paper
and old silks. But under them all was the throne.”</p>

<p>“Her voice had gradually been lifting, and by this
time the rest of the table was silent. What came to
me that time was that a story is never quite the same
for the different people who listen to it, and that no
one there could possibly be listening quite so intensely
as I—unless it were Peter. But if he was going
down with all on board, he had evidently made up
his mind to it. I caught that out of the corner of
my eye.”</p>

<p>“Did you sit on it?” asked the General, jovially.</p>

<p>“Of course I did!” answered Mrs. Maturin. “And
it was as uncomfortable as thrones are said to be.
It wasn’t a chair at all, but a kind of longish platform,
set on seven curved legs, with two or three
steps at one end. There was a balustrade around
the platform, with enameled inscriptions in cartouches
outside of it, and a high back. It ended in
a jewelled peacock with an outspread tail of turquoises,
sapphires, and emeralds. But the most
prodigious emerald of all was set in his breast.”</p>

<p>“No diamonds?” demanded Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>“None that I remember,” answered Esmeralda,
“except in the peacock’s crest. He was a wonderful
peacock, but somehow he didn’t look to me quite in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
keeping with the rest of the throne. And sure
enough, the Adorner of the Monarchy said I was
right. So many things have happened to that throne
in all the centuries it has gone knocking around
Asia; and the peacock is a modern restoration. But
there isn’t a particle of doubt about the rest of it.
Whatever happens, I can say I have sat on the
throne of Tamerlane! He began it, you know. And
Jehan Shah, that Indian Mogul who built the Taj
Mahal, finished it. And afterward it was looted from
Agra by—Who was it?” she asked, turning to me.</p>

<p>“Nadir Shah, from Delhi, in 1739,” I replied with
more particularity than perhaps was necessary.
What could I do? I couldn’t, before all those people,
point out that her history and her throne didn’t go
together. Yet each was well enough in its way—except
for the peacock. That I had never seen or heard
of. But she had not been taken in by it. After all,
I breathed more freely. Besides, the liqueurs were
being passed.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; Nadir Shah.” Mrs. Maturin took green
chartreuse. “And after his death the Kurds got hold
of it. But I never dreamed of anything so magnificent.
The gold and enamel of the throne were crusted
with precious stones, as if a swarm of gorgeous
tropical beetles had descended on it. Never in my
life have I seen so many emeralds. There was one
splendid one on the right arm, uncut and very deep
in colour, where the hands of the Shahs and the
Moguls and Tamerlane and who knows how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
other kings before him must have rested, when they
were granting life and death to the slaves at their feet.”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” burst out the lady from Pittsburgh.
“But what a pity you didn’t see it in the
palace, in its own setting, the way we saw the throne
of the Sultans in Constantinople! The ambassador
happened to be a friend of my husband’s, and as a
very special favour he got us permission to see the
old Seraglio.”</p>

<p>The infamous woman had the floor, and she didn’t
propose to relinquish it until she had told every last
detail of that routine experience which was shared
by hundreds of tourists every year before the war.
I could have cut her throat much more easily than
Mrs. Maturin could have cut Pierre Loti’s. She had
spoiled Mrs. Maturin’s story—how utterly nobody
knew better than I. And Peter’s impassive countenance
told me nothing. I shamelessly edged over
to Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>“Which one was it?” I whispered. “The one in
the peacock’s breast?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Too incredible!” She
looked around the table, where everyone but the
lady from Pittsburgh, was aware that it was time to
go to the theatre. The General, drumming a little
on the cloth, favoured me with a wink. Mrs. Maturin
decided to whisper back. “The one on the
arm. We had a terrific time about it. They nearly
ruined me for life. Your commission must have
been pretty plump! And they made us swear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
most awful oaths that we would never breathe a
word as long we lived. Then they sent us packing
that night, out of a little side door, where our carriage
was waiting, straight to Isfahan. I carried it
in my hand all the way.”</p>

<p>“But where is it?” I demanded. “Why on earth
didn’t you wear it to-night for me to see? Is it too
precious?”</p>

<p>She hesitated so queerly that my dormant uneasiness
stirred anew.</p>

<p>“Of course, if we had only been buying an emerald,
we could have found one quite as good, and for far less
in New York; though Peter insists we could not.
But then, this was not an ordinary stone. After all,
what jewel is, if you know its history? Peter had it
beautifully mounted for me—in Agra, in sight of the
Taj Mahal. As a matter of fact, though, it doesn’t
look worth the fortune we paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing does,” I said as much to myself as to
her. “Life is like that. It is the pursuit we value,
not the acquisition.”</p>

<p>“What I mean,” she explained, “is that it doesn’t
show for what it really is. Those uncut stones never
do, you know. And they don’t go with modern
clothes. So I want to have it cut. It’s the only
thing on which we differ, Peter and I. You would
never guess how sentimental he is.”</p>

<p>I somewhat perfunctorily began to assure her that
sentiment is coming into fashion again when our
hostess at last gave her signal, and we all stood up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>In the moment of confusion that followed I saw
Peter join his wife. I also saw, as I pulled away the
chair of the lady from Pittsburgh, that she, she of the
wattles and the diamonds, and not the lovely Esmeralda,
had been the one to save Peter this time.
In fact, I saw that you never can tell when life will
turn dramatic in your hands, even at so polite a
dinner-party as ours. I saw it the more distinctly
because it was so invisible. The thing was “a drama
of small, smothered, intensely private things,” as
Henry James says. Nevertheless it made me impatient
of the play for which we were already late.
Mr. Belasco, of course, would arrange everything
very much better, with tears and smiles in their
proper order. Here everything had been too long
drawn out in the beginning and too much jammed at
the end. The end, indeed, was just what was lacking,
now that Mrs. Maturin had given it so disquieting
a twist—and what I stood small chance of getting
hold of in that confounded box at the Belasco.</p>

<p>So I followed the others out of the dining-room,
much less concerned about my hat than about the
whimsicalities of playing Harun-ar-Rashid. Not
that I minded my own fix, now that I took in what
it might mean to have a beautiful lady beholden to
one for an emerald of Tamerlane. The worst was
that they might think I really had taken a commission
from that old terror in Tehran. Nor could I feel too
sorry for Mrs. Maturin. I had done my best for
her, and I had given her due warning. If she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
been taken in, if she had paid a Shah’s ransom for a
bit of green paste out of the back shop of the Adorner
of the Monarchy, it was her own fault. What a
magnificent hoax, though, pulled off in how artistic
a manner! Mr. Belasco himself couldn’t have staged
it better, or have left her so unaware of having been
taken in. And, after all, she could afford her little
caprices. Besides which, she had Peter to show for it.
He was more of a jewel than perhaps she knew. If
she didn’t, she still had her famous eyes and her famous
hair. Those were genuine enough and rare
enough, in all conscience, and nothing could rob her
of them—except time.</p>

<p>But Peter, poor old Peter, who could always play
a game, but who could never carry off the stakes:
what would time do for him? Peter disturbed me
more than anything. Had he been taken in, too?
Or—I must confess I was black enough to put that
question to myself—had he helped to take Esmeralda
in? He would almost have been justified in
doing it, hard up as he was at the time. In any case,
he must have come in for a very tidy little commission.
Otherwise how could he possibly have squared
M. Godet so soon? And I wondered if he was capable
of the sentiment with which his wife credited him
when she confided to me that he didn’t want the
emerald cut. But if it was cut—there could be no
doubt it would be if Mrs. Maturin had so made up
her mind—and if the historic jewel did turn out to
be a sham, what then? Of course I did not know for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
sure; I generally do jump at wrong conclusions. Still,
it was a very pretty little predicament even if the
stone was genuine. For—</p>

<p>At the cloak-room door I suddenly felt a hand in
my arm. It was Peter’s. He showed no trace of my
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk around to the theatre,” he proposed.
“A breath of air will be nice after all that cackle. I
have told Esmeralda. She’s going to take the General
in our car. Do you mind?”</p>

<p>I didn’t. As for Peter, he at once began to talk
quite naturally about Tehran. It amused me, on H
Street, to go back to the Lalazar. My news was a
little later than Peter’s, and I was able to tell him
details of the Turco-German invasion, the recapture
of Hamadan, the adventures of several of our
friends. Half a dozen of the young men he had
known in the Hôtel de Paris had already met their
fates in France, in Macedonia, in Mesopotamia, in
Poland. They had, at any rate—one or two of them—been
released in the most unexpected of ways
from their obligations to M. Godet. M. Godet himself,
for that matter, had not let his collection of
I. O. U.’s stand in the way of going home and taking
his own part in Armageddon.</p>

<p>These matters kept us from turning down to the
Belasco when we reached the corner of Lafayette
Square. We compromised by striking into it.
And presently Peter announced:</p>

<p>“I have enlisted, too—in the Aviation. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
took me this afternoon. I’m on the ragged edge
of being too old for it; but I’m as fit as a fiddle,
and I passed all those whirligig things they put you
through better than any of the youngsters.”</p>

<p>No one, of course, is any longer surprised by anything.
I heard myself make the usual remarks,
with a wave of my hand toward Lafayette and
Rochambeau, standing on their pedestals among
the Washington trees. Peter smiled a little.</p>

<p>“I don’t know very much about right and wrong,
and our debt to France, and all the rest of it; but
I’m not used to being a quiet family man, you know,
and you feel like a fool rolling around here in a
limousine while over there——”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, drawing me in the direction
of our theatre. He might be fit as a fiddle, but it
struck me as I glanced at him under an electric light
that he looked worn—as if, perhaps, he had been required
to produce itemised accounts, and had found
it difficult. He had nothing of his own, not even the
oil company now, and with the best possible intentions
there seemed no likelihood of his obtaining
anything commensurate with his position as the husband
of Mrs. Maturin. Charming as his wife was,
I should expect to find her a rather precise pay-master.
That was an element of the situation which
I had not taken in at first in considering what we had
brought about, Providence and I. At any rate,
Peter would never be able to slide the bill for an extremely
large and perfectly cut emerald into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
postage account—the less so as I don’t suppose he
wrote three letters a year. But long before our
winding path brought us back to the street I had
absolved him. If he had sowed his wild oat or two,
he had never been a cad. He could not have known,
poor wretch, what he was letting himself in for. He
had never been one to go smelling around antiquity
shops. He had not known until he took the emerald
to be mounted. And after the commission, the
emerald must have become a thing too terrific to
explain. Had the marriage been, perhaps, an attempt
at reparation which might not succeed? At
any rate, Peter had always needed air in moments
of exaltation. Well, he would get it. He would no
doubt get medals, too. They made me, as we sauntered
toward our belated theatre-party, a sufficiently
telling picture. I seemed to see, against a background
of sanguine mist, with perhaps a white wooden
cross visible in it, the image of a Mrs. Maturin no
longer young, fingering an emerald now never to be
cut, which was all that was left to her of the most
romantic episode of her life. But what I saw most
clearly was that life is an egregiously jumbled-up
mess, and that many nameless things, not to be mentioned
in official histories, must lie behind the momentous
decisions of life. And then at last we
reached the lighted doorway of the theatre. For
some reason or other we both hesitated to go in and
admire the well-arranged passions and admirable
upholstery of Mr. Belasco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“That was a rum affair you started us off on,
wasn’t it?” Peter suddenly exclaimed. “But, after
all, it was only fair that you should hear the rest of
the story. Did my wife tell you the end?”</p>

<p>I hedged.</p>

<p>“She told me that she got the emerald.” But I
found the courage to add: “She also told me that
she was debating whether to have it cut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did she?” uttered Peter, slowly. “Well, you
know how women are. They hate to come to a decision.
So I decided myself. I made up my mind
this morning to end the thing and take it, after all,
to the jeweller.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” ventured I, “that the jeweller was
properly impressed with the emerald of Tamerlane.
What did he say?”</p>

<p>Peter threw away his cigarette and started into
the lobby.</p>

<p>“He had nothing to say. When I got there I found
my pocket had been picked. It’s the more awkward
because I can’t help wondering if someone in the
recruiting office didn’t nab it when I was taking my
physical examination. I hardly like to accuse any
one there, especially at such a time as this. But I
don’t know how I shall tell my wife. I was so late getting
home that she went on to the dinner without me.
She’ll be frightfully upset. And you know what the
police are. I’m afraid we shall never see it again.
Heavens! Look at that clock!”</p>

<p>That business of yours, Gimlet, of a thing falling
so exactly on the tick, was rather curious.
I have an idea, though, that it happens oftener
than people might think. I’ve seen some queer examples
of it myself. I remember one in particular.
Not that it’s anything of a story. It’s merely a whiff
of a story: you make it up to suit yourself. And the
coincidence, now that I stop and think, was perhaps
the least of it! But—</p>

<p>I was up in Alaska at the time. I’ve poked about
a bit in my day, you know, and I took into my head
once to poke up there. I’d been reading Bret Harte,
that sort of thing, and I had an idea I’d do it over
again for my generation! Maybe you don’t know
that I used to have a scribbling bee in my bonnet.
I imagine that’s really what spoiled my work. I
thought if the Renaissance people practised ten or a
dozen arts equally well, I might make a stab at two.
We get these ideas when we are young, sometimes.
Moreover I didn’t know that it took more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
miners and mountains, plus a pinch of sentiment, to
make a Bret Harte. And if I did him over again you
didn’t happen to hear about it, did you? However,
I had a good time, all the same!</p>

<p>That country took me tremendously. Norway
used to be one of my favourite stamping grounds. I
was particularly fond of going up there after Italy—only
I used to wish there were a subway under Germany
when I did it! The contrast was so extraordinary—in
colour, line, atmosphere, people, everything.
Then simply to breathe in Italy, for me, was
such a <i>volupté</i> that it bordered on debauch! So after
it Norway would come like a cool repentance. And
there was a simplicity up there, a silence, a loneliness,
that rather upset me after the South. It called
out all the things with which the South has nothing
to do. There’s no use trying to describe it. It’s the
obverse, don’t you know, of <i>kennst Du das Land</i>.</p>

<p>Well, Alaska was like a bigger Norway—a Norway
with longer fiords, with taller cliffs rising out of
greener water, with bluer glaciers, with whiter and
louder waterfalls. And it had, proportionately, a
greater loneliness and a greater impression of contrast
with the rest of the world. If Norway has its
Sagas, if nightfall in some wild fiord-end seems literally
a dusk of the gods, the silence of Alaska—the
sense of its having been there for centuries by itself
with no one to hear the grind of the ice and thunder
of the waterfalls—takes you back farther yet. And
then Norway, after all, is too accessible to be quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
what it should be. Tourists may be as <i>bête</i> as you
please; but they do have a way, after all, of pouncing
on the very places you would like yourself if they
didn’t exist. The philosophy of the beaten track has
yet to be written. Alaska, however, hasn’t reached
that stage yet. She will come to it in time. She
can’t help it. More and more people go every year.
But they live on the country even less than they do
in Norway. They sit on decks and say Oh and Ah as
things sail by. They really don’t meddle very much.</p>

<p>So in the meantime the sense of contrast is one
that you can cultivate at your leisure—if you have
any. Not many of them do up there—the real people,
I mean. Life is too lively, even if they had the
inclination. And they are the very ones who bring
the contrasts most sharply to you. Heaven, the
types you see! The people from every country under
the sun, the people of every imaginable social
condition, the people with stories to them a mile
long—and not all of them printable! Of course that’s
chiefly in the mining places, and in the coast places
leading to the mining places, where they come and
go like ants in a trail, outwardly as much alike as
flannel shirts and nondescript kits can make them,
inwardly impersonating every race and passion of
the world, and all spinning out the great epic of Gold.
It’s the modern version of the Ring and the Sagas.</p>

<p>However, I wasn’t going to give you a ten-minute
talk on Alaska. I was going to tell you about my
friend the hotel-keeper in Skagway. Although the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
name almost sets me off again—on the subject of
those flimsy wooden settlements sitting unconcernedly
in the shadow of those solemn mountains, and the
bizarreness of them, and the romance of them, and
the tragedy of them! He went by the name of
Chatty Charley, did the hotel-keeper—Chat for
short—on the principle of <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>. He
was never known to utter a word without being
asked for it, and he didn’t always favour then. Who
he was or where he came from nobody knew. Not
that anybody cared. They’re not long on gossip up
there: they have other things to do. Moreover,
there is a sort of tacit understanding in the matter
of antecedents—or the lack of them. But there was
generally some tag by which you could place a man.
It didn’t take you long to make up your mind that
he would be a bar-keep in San Francisco, or a drummer
in Chicago, or a sophomore in Harvard. Not
that those exhausted the possibilities by any means.</p>

<p>Chatty, however, I had no idea about. Or perhaps
it would be truer to say I had a hundred. He
would have fitted in anywhere—except Alaska. He
was the last man I expected to find up there. Not
that he had so much the air of a tenderfoot. And I
don’t mean any of your high melodrama business—a
Lost Heir or a Blighted Being or any of that. It
was merely that he was rather a slight man, and
wonderfully meek to look upon. He got on wonderfully
well, though. He had a name for being square,
which in a society like that goes rather farther than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
it does in ours, I fancy. You could be as much of
a tenderfoot as you pleased; but if you took what
was coming to you, and didn’t shoot too much bull,
and played a square game, they’d be pretty sure
to let you through.</p>

<p>So Chatty did a roaring business. And we were
great cronies from the start. It was so much so that
the others thought we knew rather more about each
other than we let on. There may have been something
in it—I don’t know. However, the reason of it
was rather funny. The first time I went into his
place—and it was a place, too: if I once began telling
you about it, and the things you saw!—the first time
I went into his place I noticed right off, among the
newspaper cartoons and wild odds and ends which he
or the boys had tacked up around the walls, some
pictures of Venice—some of those photogravures
they get out, you know. Well, I never thought much
of them as works of art, although I’ve seen them in
rather unexpected places. But this was the most
unexpected of all. The contrast of it hit me like a
bullet—that wonderful old town with its perfection
of a flower and its hundreds of years—and such
years!—behind it, and this wild new raw scrambling
place huddled under unknown mountains on the edge
of an unknown sea! It knocked me all of a heap. I
went staring around like a boob, not noticing much
else, until I happened to notice a peaceful person
behind the bar who was looking at me.</p>

<p>“Where the devil did these things come from?” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
demanded of him rather abruptly, less by way of
conversation than of uttering the question that was
uppermost in my mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, I picked them up,” replied the peaceful person,
who turned out to be Chatty.</p>

<p>“Been there?” I pursued.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered.</p>

<p>It was a mild enough remark, heaven knows. And
there was nothing in the way he made it, except a
certain matter-of-courseness. But that was just
what knocked me all of a heap again. How should
anybody in Alaska, most of all how should anybody
in Skagway, have been to Venice except myself?
And then I’m clean dotty on the place, anyway. It
gets into your blood, you know, and it got into mine
before anything else did. I go back there whenever
I get a chance, and I can forgive much of a man who
betrays a weakness for it. That is one of two or
three touchstones I keep in my pocket! So I fell on
Chatty and began talking about his pictures, and the
place they came from, and he seemed to know all
about it. He even knew what I never knew any one
else to know—the islands in the lagoon. The Venetians
themselves don’t know them. They are tremendous
landlubbers, gondoliers and all, and apparently
make it a point to learn as little as possible of
the shallow green sea in which they swim. While as
for the tourists, poor dears, they go to the Lido, and
Chioggia, and San Lazzaro, and Murano, and Burano,
and Torcello, and possibly San Francesco in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
Deserto, and <i>basta</i>. Chatty also knew Italian, I incidentally
discovered. Indeed there came times,
once or twice, when we found it rather convenient.
You couldn’t be sure of not getting caught, though.
There are too many funny things prowling around
up there under miners’ hats for you to trust to no
one’s understanding your lingo.</p>

<p>Well, for such a short acquaintance we got fairly
chummy, Chatty and I. It was so to a degree that
made the boys horse him for actually chatting. Not
that he really did chat much. He evidently liked to
listen to my chatter though, and once in a while,
when nobody in particular was around, he would say
something about some palace, some garden, some
island, that we both knew. It was rather amusing—in
Skagway. But the real nature of our relation was
still more amusing. I never knew a man so well and
so little. For all our chumminess we never had one
word on any earthly subject except Venice. I never
even got a hint of what he had been up to there, or
when, or how, or why, or anything. I had no more
idea than the cat on the stairs what part Venice
played in the scheme of his existence—any more than
I had an idea, above the immediate and obvious one
of the hotel, what part Skagway played. He had an
absolutely impersonal way of talking, if he talked at
all, that left nothing to take hold of. And I never
could quite make out whether it was modesty or design—or
whether, perhaps, nothing but Venice had
ever happened to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>Of course, after the first surprise—there were various
degrees of it as the character of our queer little
bond came out—I used to wonder a good deal. But
I finally settled down to a sense of the picturesqueness
of the business. Our queer little bond, after all,
was quite a bond. Marriages have been made on
less! And to have such a bond in such a place—one
was about as strange as the other. So I gave up any
idea of trying to draw the man out. I had made
some rather idiotic attempts in that direction. And
I used to amuse myself by making the most of our
two points of view. I had gone up there for the sake
of the wildness and the coolness and the stillness,
only to encounter this individual who thought of
nothing but Italy! He typified for me the reaching
out of the North for the South, the old restlessness
of man for the things he has not, which Goethe has
put into “Wilhelm Meister.”</p>

<p>I don’t know whether I would ever have got any
farther but for what your story suggested—the rather
odd coincidence. And I’m not sure how far I got
then. At all events, I was sitting one night at the
end of a pier there was down behind Chatty’s hotel,
looking at the fiord—the inlet, they call it there. It
was late on a Saturday night in July, about half past
eleven or twelve. Things were rather nice in the
warm dusk of that northern summer, with the mountains
standing up purply-black against a sky that
still had a glow in it. What I was chiefly noticing,
however, was a yacht that had been there a day or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
two and was preparing to leave. The rattle of the
anchor-chain in the winch, and the splash of the
water as the links came dripping up, were loud
against the Saturday night noises of the town. And
on the deck, where there was a blur of white, I could
hear voices, and the fingering of a guitar. I don’t
know—it was too much for me. There is something
about a boat at night, anyway, with the lighted port-holes,
and everything.... And then I had been
knocking about a good bit up there, and I suppose I
was ready to swing around to the other extreme.
Anyway, I was pretty near something like homesickness.
Which was not at all what I had been when I
saw some of the yachters in the town that morning.</p>

<p>As I was chewing it over I heard steps behind me
on the pier, rather to my disgust. It turned out to
be Chatty, though.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Beau,” he remarked, kicking his heels off
the end of the pier beside me. “Celebrating <i>Redentor</i>?”</p>

<p>Do you know what <i>Redentor</i> is? If you don’t, just
let me tell you that it is one of the last pieces of paganism
left in the world. It’s a midsummer <i>festa</i> in
Venice, when the whole town and most of the adjoining
mainland spend the evening in boats, eating and
drinking and singing under paper lanterns. Then
they all go out to the Lido and finish up the night
dancing on the sands. And when the sun bobs over
the edge of the Adriatic they shout like heathen, and
a lot of them pull off their clothes and tear down into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the water. It’s the most pagan thing you ever saw.
All this is really the eve of a religious festival that
comes on the Sunday. But that is a sad and sleepy
anticlimax—at best a mere excuse for prolonging
the festivities, which are of the crown of the Venetian
year.</p>

<p>Well, I reckoned up and found that Chatty was
right. It was, barring differences of time, the night
of <i>Redentor</i>. I wondered why I hadn’t thought of it.
And the sudden sense of contrast pressed upon me
more strongly than ever—the contrast between that
palace-bordered canal so far away on the other side
of the world, with its flower-lanterns blowing in the
darkness, its catches of song, its breath of all that
is old and warm and human and I don’t know
what, and this wild place of the North in its unearthly
dusk, so precisely the opposite! I’m not much on
the sentimental line; but there are times when I cave,
and that was one of them.</p>

<p>We both sat there, thinking the same things, I
suppose, while the windlass clinked in the silence.
Then from the group of people on the deck of the
yacht, what do you suppose we heard? You couldn’t
imagine. It was the song, the very identical song
about love and the sea, which the Venetians sing on
the night of <i>Redentor</i>! Distinctly to us over the
water, in a woman’s voice, to the accompaniment of
a guitar, came the Venetian words. In such a voice,
too!</p>

<p>I looked at Chatty, and Chatty looked at me. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
was incredible. It was incredible enough that he and
I should be there; but a third person, and just on
that night! At the moment, however, I didn’t have
time to take in how incredible it was, because as we
sat staring at each other the anchor came up with a
big splash. Then the yacht began to circle in a half
moon off the head of the pier, and glided away like
a great white swan. We could hear the woman singing
as she went. That was to me even more than the
coincidence—the rush of things I had been so long
without, those old common conventional things that
we so hate when we have them every day! I suppose
I looked queer. Chatty did—for Chatty.</p>

<p>“Do you know her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Know her!” I burst out. “How the devil should
I know her? I only wish I did. I’d be steaming down
to Seattle instead of kicking my heels over Chilkoot
Inlet.”</p>

<p>He looked away toward the yacht.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said. “You knew so many of the things,
I thought—perhaps——”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t happen to this time. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Chatty.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what he said, if you please: “yes!”
I couldn’t have been more amazed if the pier had
suddenly begun flying through the air.</p>

<p>“Know her, man!” I cried. And then I remembered.
“Oh, I suppose you saw them upstreet this
morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“Did <i>you</i>?” he asked. He seemed interested.</p>

<p>“How could I help it?” I rejoined. “You can tell
that kind of people a mile off, up here.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said. “I didn’t happen to. I’m in the
hotel a good deal, you know.”</p>

<p>He looked away again. But I began to get interested.</p>

<p>“How on earth do you know her, then?” I demanded
with more curiosity than discretion.</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered slowly, “I used to live in the
same house with her—over there.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand in the direction of the disappearing
boat. At that my discretion fared worse
than before. It was really, though, with an idea of
carrying the thing off lightly that I asked:</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s the same one?”</p>

<p>He barely smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, a voice, you know—sometimes it sort of
sticks in your head. I suppose you think it’s queer.
But I could tell you her name—and everything.”</p>

<p>He didn’t, let me state in passing. But Chatty
did tell me something. I don’t think it was because
I was I—if you gather anything from that elegant
phrase! Of course, our bond made me less objectionable
than I might have been. But the truth of it
was that the spring had been touched and the panel
had to yield. Not that I got more than a peep into
the secret recess, though. I only saw what lay in
front.</p>

<p>“H’m!” mused Chatty aloud, partly to himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
and partly to me. “What a funny girl she was! She
was one of those girls who begin to learn things too
soon and get through learning them too late. She
was rather young, then, too. She was big and black
and pale and awkward, and not very pretty.” Then,
“Was there anybody like that among the people you
saw?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>I considered.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be,” he volunteered somewhat inconsequently.
After which he went on: “People
liked her all the same. There were dozens of them
ready to jump into the Canal for her, even then. And
I guess some of ’em did. I didn’t, though. I didn’t
like her. I liked to hear her sing, but that was all.
I had an idea she posed. She struck me as doing the
high tragedy act, and I didn’t much care for it. She
had funny ways, too. She used to come into my
room at all hours of day and night, and I thought she
was up to that sham Bohemian game they put on
sometimes when they get a chance. Not that I’m
so terribly straitlaced myself; but I like people to be
what they are, and I didn’t think she was. Oh, I had
ideas then!”</p>

<p>He stopped, did Chatty, as we watched the last of
the yacht. It faded like a ghost into the purple of
the cliffs.</p>

<p>“Yes, she was a funny girl,” he finally said. Then
he put his hand into his pocket and drew out the
classic pocketbook. From it, however, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
neither the classic photograph nor the classic lock of
hair—not even the classic rose. But I will admit
that he did produce a desiccated vegetable of some
sort. This he held up to himself and to me. “When
I went away,” he said, “she came into my room to
watch me pack. She had been in the garden, and she
had a big branch of lemon verbena. She broke off a
sprig every now and then and threw it into the trunk.
I found them all over everything, afterwards. ‘When
you get to America,’ she said, ‘it will remind you of
the girl you didn’t like and who didn’t like you.’”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked down the inlet. Then he
looked at his sprig again. I wondered what to say.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I uttered tamely. “So you keep it to remind
you of the girl you didn’t like!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said—“and who didn’t like me.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>We never would have seen the place if the idea
had not beguiled us, at Trent, of driving
through the Dolomites to Bassano. And I
doubt whether we would have been so extravagant
about it if we had not just come from Germany. Is
any quiver quite like that with which the returning
victim of Italy greets his first cypress, his first olive
tree, his first campanile? We formed imperishable
ties with our <i>irredentista</i> driver, chiefly because he
told us that the inhabitants of his dark little mountain
city had turned the back of their statue of Dante
to the North. Moreover it was May; and I should
perhaps confess that we were too recently married
to be altogether responsible. So when we discovered
the castle that afternoon as we jingled down the widening
gorge of the Val Sugana, we agreed that a
princess must be shut up in the tower. Whereupon,
as if in confirmation of our insight, an invisible
dragon suddenly made himself heard behind the
walls.</p>

<p>Otherwise there was no sign of habitation about
the place. The rusty wrought-iron gate through
which we stopped to look, the weed-checkered flagging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
within, the ruinous little chapel half averted
from us at the right, the cracked and discoloured
shafts outlining the court, the gaunt old pile of dark
stone with its machicolated tower, formed a picture
of abandonment which the dog’s barking made a
trifle uncanny. But severe and even formidable as
the castle was, in spite of its neglect, it had the
nobility of perfect proportion. It was not so much
a castle, indeed, as a castellated villa. The great
arched windows of the façade were scarcely of a
period when Ezzelino da Romano scoured these valleys
o’ nights. Neither were the quarterfoils piercing
the parapet of the roof. I remember how exquisite
the spring sky looked through them, and between
the square merlons of the tower. That element of
contrast, taken with all the other circumstances,
gave the structure a curious intensity of expression.
There was something tragic in the way it lifted itself
against the light.</p>

<p>It was part of the effect, and of the incredible
richness of Italy, that our friend the driver could
tell us nothing about the place. It was merely a
<i>castello qualunque</i>! Yet how little was it a <i>castello
qualunque</i> we began to learn not long after we had
started on, skirting the wall that hid the princess’s
dragon until her castle suddenly revealed itself to us,
at a turn of the road, under a second and more
romantic aspect. And this in spite of the fact that
nothing more romantic than a few strands of barbed
wire closed what must once have been the state entrance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Of course we stopped again—to look at the
semicircular recess in the wall, with its lichened stone
seats and couchant lions. Between them opened an
avenue, I don’t know how many hundred yards long,
of cypresses I don’t know how many hundred years
old, that marched and dipped and rose again with
such an air to the steps of a balustrated terrace in
front of the castle! This fairy arcade, jewel-green
with moss as if no one had trodden it for a century
and cross-lighted by a westering sun, seemed to lead
to some palace of enchantment rather than to the
melancholy place we just had passed. So different
a face did the villa turn to us now, with a loggia
lightening its upper story and the Alps spreading a
veil of magic behind it, that even the tower lost its
grimness in the golden air. We therefore changed
our minds about the princess. We decided that she
was lying asleep there as a princess should, waiting
for her prince.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was only when we perceived farther down the
wall to the left an archway opening into a white farm
court, and an old peasant woman looking out of it,
that we came back to the ordinary affairs of life.
Which, for ourselves, consisted in getting to Bassano.
And we found it, after following out of our rocky
gorge a river that no one would have suspected of
being the lazy Venetian Brenta, one of the most
seductive little towns in the universe. Its ivied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
walls, its capricious streets, its overshadowing eaves,
its pictured façades, its covered bridge, its noisy
green river, so ravished two wanderers fresh from
the pseudo-classicism of Munich that they instantly
resolved to spend there the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p>Certain obstacles, however, opposed this project.
The hotels, otherwise perfect establishments of their
kind, afforded no outlook save upon the blackest
alleys. And these on market mornings were nothing
less than bedlam. Moreover a heavenly apartment
we had descried from afar, at the top of a house
overhanging the Brenta, with a corner loggia that
reminded us of the one we had seen in the Val Sugana—an
apartment after which no other apartment in
the world could make us happy—was occupied by
an unnatural parent of many children who refused
to entertain our polite proposal that she vacate in
our favour, even when we proved to her that we
would save her offspring’s lives in taking the lease
off her hands.</p>

<p>So when our Dæmon led us, sad and destitute of
matches, not only to the Caffè al Mondo but to the
table next Principe Montughi, we fell as ripe plums
into his mouth. But my phrase is far from happy if
it lead the reader to imagine that he is about to be
treated to a portrait of the dark and designing Italian
of romance. In the first place, Principe Montughi
might very well have been described as fair. In all
his subsequent dealings with us he certainly was.
In the second place, the suggestion that we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
occupy a part of his villa had its origin, I remember,
in the audacity of my wife. For the rest, I am ready
to allow that he was one of the most imposing persons
I ever met. The mere sight of his silk hat was
a lesson in worldly wisdom, while the air with which
he offered me—no: with which he proffered me—the
match of destiny made me realise that I must be
born again, and a Latin, to carry life off with such a
hand. What was more striking about him, though,
at least to my Anglo-Saxon eye, was the way he
filled his immaculate morning-coat, as if no clothes
could ever be big enough for his arms and shoulders.
And his head, which was set close to them, looked
better suited to batter in gates than to carry silk
hats. But its size and squareness and general competence
contrasted oddly, again, with the eyes. These
were of so pale a blue that from a distance they had
the emptiness of a statue’s gaze. I wondered whether
it were the contiguity of them, or the extreme narrowness
of the forehead above them, or the surprised
flare of their nearly intermingled eyebrows,
that gave them the look of trouble so magnificently
contradicted by everything else about the Prince.</p>

<p>Therefore when I say that we fell as ripe plums
into his mouth, I merely choose a less graceful,
though perhaps less pompous, way of saying that
fate had prepared us for him and him for us. And I
shall waste no time in pretending that his villa was
not the one we had seen up the river. That would
make too light of an element of the fatal in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
chance relation of which I, for one, became increasingly
conscious. Yet after the way we had gone on
about the place, he could scarcely do less than invite
us to drive out the next day and see it.</p>

<p>If we secretly trembled lest our first impression
were destined to suffer the common lot of first impressions,
we proved that we had been right after
all. We began to know it as soon as we clattered
under the archway of the <i>podere</i>, passed out of the
picturesque white court into an olive yard, skirted
an old garden that had gone all to birds and bushes,
and looked down from the terrace into the delicious
morning freshness of the cypress avenue. But what
really clinched us was the loggia. This was nothing
less than a great marble room, opening out of the
upper hall of the villa. There were windows on
either hand of the door, and in each side wall a niche
where statues once had been. As for the front, it
was a triptych framed between the low marble parapet
and the pillars supporting the roof, wherein were
set, with all the art of an Italian May morning, the
tangled green of the garden, and the valley shut in
between its rocky walls, and the Brenta shining past
vineyards and stone pines and scattered farms into
a sea of misty sunlight that was the Lombard
Plain.</p>

<p>Such a loggia—such a place to work in, to play
in, to eat in, to sleep in, to live in—never was on sea
or land. Once we set foot in it we forgot Bassano
and the unnatural parent and every other human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
tie; and the <i>Principe</i> was lost. I don’t believe he
could have got rid of us if he had wanted to. Though,
for that matter, I have always wondered why he
didn’t. Which is not saying that we did not discover
reasons enough for his keeping us. But as it
was he smiled indulgently at our enthusiasm over his
barrack, as he called it, apologised for its dilapidated
condition, and said that if we would give him time
he would make a few necessary improvements. Such,
for instance, as scraping the moss from the avenue of
cypresses. This proposal we rejected in horror, crying
out that we should never dream of using that
entrance and that we would infinitely prefer him to
scrape the tiles off the floors. We did agree, however,
that he should supply service and an occasional
carriage, in addition to our meals. With which understanding
we took a reluctant leave, warning the
<i>Principe</i> to expect us not later than the evening of
the second day.</p>

<p>And thus it was that from a carriage hired in the
whim of a honeymoon we alighted in an episode the
most memorable of our lives.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When we returned to take possession, the first
person we saw was Principe Montughi. No less
suave and impeccable as landlord than as host, he
showed us to our rooms, introduced Graziosa, the
little peasant girl who was to be our maid, and said
dinner would be served at seven o’clock. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
sorry he had neglected to ask what we wished, and
at what time we wished it; but if we would be good
enough to put up with our first repast, he hoped we
could in the future suit ourselves so far as the resources
of his inadequate establishment permitted.
He then withdrew, and we proceeded to settle ourselves
in our new domain.</p>

<p>Not that there was much settling to be done. Our
belongings were no more numerous than could be
carried in trunks, while the rooms in which we disposed
them were preposterously bare. We suspected
that the furniture had gone the way of the front
gates, which had been so admired by a passing compatriot
of ours that the Prince said he had parted
with them for ten times their value and had not yet
got around to replacing them. Neither had he yet
found time to make other repairs that some people
might have considered more pressing. But that was
a part of our picnic, as we regarded it. We could
have furniture and tight windows at home; but we
couldn’t have such big cool echoing rooms, or such
a loggia, or such a garden, or such a <i>podere</i>, or such
an olive yard running down to such a river.</p>

<p>Accordingly we were the more surprised by the
dinner which Graziosa presently came to tell us was
served on the terrace. It was no picnic art with
which our uninstructed underlings had set the table
and arranged the flowers and the brass <i>fiorentine</i> we
might need later on, with which they had chosen
just the right point for looking down the avenue or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
catching the last light of sunset on the tower. So
keenly did we realise it that we were ready to give
them credit for the stately setting of the terrace, for
the mellowness of cracked marble and foot-worn
brick and weathered stone, for the rich evening stillness
of the garden and the fluting of the birds among
the trees. We felt rather like persons in a play, sitting
down to a stage dinner. When the soup came
on we wondered whether it would be real.</p>

<p>It was—like the delicious trout that followed it,
like the dish of macaroni and frizzled eggplant that
formed the irresistible piece of resistance, like the
crisp salad which prepared the way for a Gorgonzola
I would now commit crimes for, like the far from
histrionic Verona which bore us through to the coffee.
It was all so real, and so acute a sense of the joy of
life filled us when at last Graziosa lighted the wicks
of the <i>fiorentine</i> and left us to a platter of walnuts
and a carafe of Marsala, that we hadn’t the heart to
call her back for nut-crackers. Besides, my wife
wanted the secret of that masterpiece of resistance.
So she decided to go and ask the old woman herself.
And I went along too.</p>

<p>There was more than one piece of foolishness between
us, I remember, as we made for the corner of
the villa—the one Graziosa had turned as she came
and went with our plates. I remember it, and a
nightingale in the garden, and our serious agreement
that “it” was all “wonderful,” as one unaccountably
remembers longest a few of the least serious moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
of life. But I remember too the curious change in
atmosphere, almost like a breath of chilled air, which
we detected even in our foolishness and in that dim
light, when the end of the castle lifted its stark mass
above us, with the tower darkly overtopping the
farther angle. We walked toward it. And presently
we made out, beyond a black blotch that suggested
a door, two little lighted windows. They twinkled
like a pair of eyes, rather too far above the ground
for us to look into. I fear we might have done so,
then; for in the back of both our heads was a desire
to become better acquainted with our romantic domain.
A sudden growl in the darkness, however,
decided us for the door.</p>

<p>It proved not to be locked. The enormous raftered
room into which we stepped, hand still in hand,
must have been the original kitchen of the castle. I
caught a hasty impression of a vast fireplace, on a
central platform under a chimney hood, of tins and
coppers and brasses glimmering dully, of Graziosa
standing statue-like with a candle. What almost
immediately held my eye was a superb three-legged
pot of hammered copper full of lettuce heads, standing
in the fireplace. Going over to look at it more
closely, I became aware that someone else was in
the room. My surprise was the greater because this
person was not at all the old woman of the farm, or
her husband either. It was a man who sat in the
shadow at one side in a chef’s white cap. He rose
silently from the deal table at which he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
eating the remains of our dinner. And then, to my
stupefaction, I recognised the Prince himself.</p>

<p>He took off his white cap and bowed, magnificent
as ever. What a feat that was I cannot hope to make
clear in a land where we are as used to great changes
of fortune as we are to the somewhat inadequate
service, at summer hotels, of young gentlemen from
the universities. The sense of it flashed for me, as I
took in the Prince’s masquerade, into a surprised
consciousness of a parallel between the man and his
house—in which a sense of strange and lamentable
things mingled inarticulately with the recognition of
a personal force even deeper than I had suspected.</p>

<p>I wish that had been the only reason for the open-mouthed
spectacle we made of ourselves. But the
transition from the silk hat to the white cap—under
which the flare of the Prince’s eyebrows looked
startlingly made up—was so abrupt, it so carried out
our earlier stage illusion, that it is no satisfaction to
recall how far we were from smiles. The stare we
gave, the glances we involuntarily exchanged, were
just as gross.</p>

<p>Of course after that first ignoble moment, which
I hope was not so long as the telling of it, we
were both eager to extend the right hand of fellowship.
But Montughi cut the ground from under
our feet.</p>

<p>“Graziosa,” he commanded, “the <i>signori</i> have lost
their way. Show them up to their rooms.”</p>

<p>I don’t suppose it was five minutes from the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
we left the table on the terrace before we found ourselves
back in our loggia, watching the receding
glimmer of Graziosa’s candle and listening to the
echo of her footsteps die away in the dark house.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He showed us our place, did the <i>Principe</i>, and we
sat in it.</p>

<p>I won’t say that we didn’t wriggle in it a little, at
first. We naturally wanted to show him that if we
had broken into his kitchen we were no pair of mere
inquisitive snoopers, and that the fact of our having
caught him in cap and apron could not make the
slightest difference in our relations—unless to improve
them. But that was precisely what the <i>Principe</i>
would not let us do. Such overtures as we made
in that direction encountered a stony impassivity
which taught us our own unwilling rôle. This was
to make two personages of our landlord and of our
cook. The former was the impeccable gentleman of
the world we had accidentally met at Bassano, who
honoured us with an occasional call and who once a
week drove splendidly away to town in the old
caleche which remained the rest of the time at our
disposal. The latter was an invisible chef of no less
distinguished qualities. If when we took in the situation
and realised that we would never be able to
scold our cook we both felt a certain dismay, it was
speedily dispelled by the discovery that our cook
never required a scolding. But never did he in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
character refer to the other. And never, after one or
two futile attempts, did we.</p>

<p>The thing was really preposterous. There we
were, the three of us, cut off from the world as if we
had been castaways on a desert island, and the man
went on to the end pretending now not to be Prince
and now not to be cook. A hundred times I was
on the edge of bursting out: “Come, my dear fellow,
don’t make things so hard for yourself and for us.”
Only—I never did! On the contrary, we sometimes
went so far as to ask ourselves whether the two personages
might not be separate after all.</p>

<p>We smiled when we recalled our simple anticipations
in becoming co-tenants of Castello Montughi.
One of them had been that we should at last see
something of what the sojourner in Italy so rarely
does, an Italian interior. Whereas we discovered
that, like everybody else, we were to see nothing at
all. Perhaps it was our pique at finding ourselves in
so curious and unexpected a subjection that searched
for any possible flaw in the Prince’s acting, that divined
a secret source of indifference under his pride.
More was there than we knew, but we didn’t much
matter one way or the other. I presume we felt it
because we thought—and I still think—one reason
for our singular relation was that we brought him a
breath, such as it was, from a wider world than Val
Sugana. At all events it was impossible for us to be
indifferent about him. Who on earth was he? We
could not help asking each other that question, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
feeling sure that it had an answer. And what had
brought him to the straits in which we found him?
And why, most of all, did he inhabit this tumble-down
castle in the Dolomites when such a personality
as his could not fail elsewhere to make its mark?</p>

<p>We kept our questions to ourselves, however. We
also kept, after that first misadventure, to our part
of the house. But I would create an entirely false
impression if I seemed to insinuate that we breathed
an air of Maeterlinck or of Poe. What would you?
The year was yet young, we ourselves were by no
means old, we happened to have stumbled at a moment
not the least romantic in life into a setting of
the most romantic. Nor did Montughi’s eccentricity
make it less so. The half-ruined castle, the lonely
valley, the rushing river, reacted upon our new-world
sensitiveness to such stimuli in a way we could
scarcely have resisted. Such twilights as darkened
our deserted garden and our great echoing rooms
demanded a ghost. And we devoutly continued to
believe in the princess who should inhabit the tower.</p>

<p>We took her, like her tower and her loggia and her
enchanted avenue of cypresses, for granted—as a piece
of the Argument from Design, whereby all things
existed for the edification of two wandering Americans
who had not long been married. We also took
her, it must be said in further disclaimer of that insinuation
to which I have just alluded, with giggles.
Was she not red-haired, whose head we were one
day to behold in a casement or an embrasure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
tower? On that we usually agreed. My wife, however,
held that the mysterious lady was a flame of
Montughi’s for whom he had ruined himself and
whom he had borne away to this solitary retreat to
be free of the world and its conventions, to say nothing
of importunate husbands. Whereas according
to my own less decorative theory our princess was
an elderly female relative, possibly a wife but probably
a maiden aunt, who suffered from a Jane Eyre-ish
disability of the mental organs, requiring a régime
of country air and close surveillance.</p>

<p>In any case, she remained even more obstinately
invisible than our princely cook. But while it of
course kept alive our more or less humorous speculations
to see, after dark, slits of light in the irregularly
spaced loopholes of the tower, or sometimes to
hear notes from a faraway violin which was doubtless
a gramophone, we elaborately avoided the other side
of the castle. Although we could laugh about Montughi,
we did not wish to give him another occasion
for putting us in the wrong. For the same reason
we pretended at first to be cool toward Graziosa and
the good old people at the <i>podere</i>. And I presume it
was not wholly our imagination that sensed a reserve
under their Latin manners. That pretense did not
last long, however. There is a fatal affinity between
exiles in Italy and those who serve them. Moreover
our unwillingness to use the Prince’s gate too often,
or to lacerate ourselves by crawling through the
barbed wire of our own, made it necessary for us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
go in and out of the farmyard. So we ended by becoming
fast friends with the peasants who lived there.
Also with their dragon, the watchdog of the place.
This was a huge white shaggy creature whom my
wife christened Abracadabra and whom we promptly
set about corrupting. He was always let loose at
night.</p>

<p>For the rest, we spent more and more time prowling
about the country. One reason was the <i>Principe</i>.
We had a rather absurd idea that he might like his
place to himself, once in a while. Another was that
we found the garden more charming to look at than
to idle in, especially after dewfall. It was not for
nothing that the moss of the avenue kept so fairy
green. Dank that garden was, even beyond the shadow
of its tall cypresses. The filmed statues showed
it, and the weedy paths. But there were pleasant
places along the river, we discovered, of sun-warmed
or branch-shaded rocks. There were vineyards
hanging on the slopes of the valley, there were cool
chestnut glens, there were other farms and other
villas—though none so noble as ours. At night, too,
as spring lengthened into summer, we often strolled
up the road toward Austria or down toward Bassano,
stopping to chat at the <i>podere</i> on our way back.
Graziosa would always light us upstairs, as she had
done that first night. Then we always ended by
sitting in the loggia by ourselves, not without more
chatter. God knows where we found so much to
say, but we were never through. Still, we also found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
time to listen to the river and the nightingales, to
watch the fireflies in the garden, the stars above the
jagged dark rim of the valley, the distant twinkle
of the plain.</p>

<p>It was an unforgettable summer.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>To us it was unforgettable. Otherwise we must
have flitted long before we did to scenes where we
needed to walk less softly. Yet just that necessity
of walking softly was part of the lure. Like so much
else of life, however, it was in great part a thing of
atmosphere, of colour, of accent, of states of feeling,
of moments so real to us but so impossible to capture
in word or line that I oftenest think of Castello
Montughi in terms of music. It was another similarity
of that episode to a piece of music that while the
successive phases of it could hardly be labelled as
chapters or acts, the transitions between them were
perfectly clear. We had begun with an <i>Andante</i>.
We had gone on to an <i>Allegro ma non troppo</i>. The
third movement—it had settled down into a <i>Scherzo</i>,
of the mellower kind. And the final resolution?</p>

<p>That was a <i>Lamentoso</i>. And the transition, when
at last it came, was so unnerving that I was thankful
my wife was not with me. She had been having a
touch of malaria—due, I am afraid, to the dampness
of the place. I was not really uneasy about her,
though, beyond asking myself whether it were time
for us to make a move. After she dropped to sleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
late in the evening, I went out to stretch my legs and
get a breath of air.</p>

<p>Without any definite intention, I found myself
walking up the valley. That was the direction I always
liked best after sundown. The mountains
stood out so solemnly against the stars, and the river
made such a sound in the dark. I can hear it now.
And I can see how sombre the castle and its merloned
tower loomed before me when I went back that night.
It put me in mind of the first time I had seen them.
As I drew near the gate, too, I heard the dog. But
it was no bark that came from him. It was a howl,
long drawn and mournful. In a moment, however,
I discovered what pulled me up short. For there
were lights in the little chapel.</p>

<p>My first thought was of fire—until I had time to
note that the light was perfectly steady, and to reflect
that there was probably nothing left in the
chapel to burn. Whereupon, as I watched the glimmer
of the dusty old leaded panes, I grew extremely
uncomfortable. In fact the hour, the uncanny noise
of the dog, the unaccustomed circumstance of the
illuminated chapel, all the other circumstances of the
place, combined to give me a sensation I have rarely
experienced. There have been times when I would
be ashamed to make such a confession. But years
have emboldened me to think that fearlessness is an
insensibility of the nerves which a man should pray
to be delivered from. His affair is to be scared as
often and as violently as he pleases, but to keep his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
head. Which, I presume, was the reason why it
seemed to me worthy to investigate. I therefore tiptoed
around to the other entrance, where I almost
yielded to a temptation to wake up the peasants.
Luckily Abracadabra saved me from it by bounding
at me out of the dark with a growl. When he recognised
me he trotted quietly along beside me. That
growl, however, reminded me of another time when
I had investigated, and had been sorry for it. I gave
Abracadabra a good-night pat and went into the
house.</p>

<p>I found my wife still asleep. I could make out her
quiet breathing, and the soft curve of her arm across
the pillow. As I bent over her I heard Abracadabra
again. I went out to the loggia. It was too late for
nightingales. There were cicadas, now, in the cypresses.
The melancholy shrilling of them, out of the
black shadow, affected me almost as much as the
dog. He had stopped his noise, though. I could see
the ghostly shape of him down on the terrace, waiting.
I don’t know—I felt a sudden shame of my
retreat. I tiptoed back to my room, picked up my
revolver, touched the soft arm on the pillow with my
lips, and stole down stairs.</p>

<p>The dog ran to meet me at the terrace door, wagging
his tail and sticking his cold nose into my hand.
We turned the corner, we passed the low arch leading
into the kitchen. The two little windows beside it
were dark. So were the loopholes of the tower.
But, beyond that redoubtable angle, I found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
light still burning in the chapel. I wished the door
were open at least a crack. I also wished, in spite of
Abracadabra’s company, that I had not undertaken
to prove I was not a coward. I stood there looking,
listening, seeing nothing but those faintly lighted
panes, hearing nothing but the cicadas and the
river. I wondered if it were the sound of my
own blood, unwilling as I was to go forward or to
go back.</p>

<p>Presently, from inside the chapel, I heard a violin.
Of that, this time, there could be no doubt. And in
the stillness I recognised that sobbing theme from
the Sixth Symphony of Chaikovsky, which everybody
knows and sentimentalises over or laughs at.
But nobody ever heard it as I heard it that night in
the shadow of Castello Montughi, while cicadas
chanted ethereally in the black cypresses and the
Brenta muttered among its rocks. I didn’t laugh.
I stood quivering. The theme swept on to its climax,
returned, flowered magically, tragically, into developments
I had never listened to or dreamed. If I
can’t play a violin myself, I have sat in front of all
the Russians and Jews and Gypsies who can. But
no one of them ever let loose with his bow such pent-up
passion and misery. Not one, ever. There was
no mere poetry in that violin. There was heartbreak
in it. There was damnation in it. There were
wild tears, pleading, hunger, hopelessness, remorse.
There was in it all of life that is unfulfilled and not
to be assuaged and beyond utterance. And all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
poured out in a tone of gold, with the stroke of a god—or
a demon.</p>

<p>No wonder that infernal dog started howling again.
I could have howled myself. I’m not sure that I
didn’t. However, before I could stop him the dog
broke away from me. He leaped forward to the
chapel door, scratched at it, finally threw his big
body against it. The latch gave and the door flew
open. The dog disappeared inside. As he did so I
heard, instead of the music, a sort of crack and a
brief whine. But what I saw, across the dark court,
left me no time to think of that. For the moment I
was too astonished even to be startled. Little as I
had expected what lay behind the door, I expected
nothing less than those two great candles and that
statuesque profile upturned between them. The
delicate line of the profile was incredibly white
against the frescoed wall of the chapel. Then it
came over me that she was not carved in marble, on
a mediæval tomb, but that she was dead, lying there
on her bier, in her <i>capella ardente</i>—that woman
whose exquisitely cut features wore such an air of
race.</p>

<p>For what I did afterward I don’t know whether
I had an excuse or not. At first I was absurdly,
horribly, shaken. I have a physical shrinking from
death that is too much for me. I would rather have
faced any marauder than that dead princess whom I
had never seen, lying so white and silent between her
candles, with her black hair sweeping down about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
her. Then the violin: there had been about it something
unearthly. Could I have been imagining
again? Could that have been a music of the supernatural?
But as my senses grew calmer, as there
came back to me the remembrance of all that had
set this place so apart in my life, as I thought of the
warm arm I had kissed a few minutes ago, watching
that profile whose still beauty seemed the very image
of a pure and noble pride, the mystery and awesomeness
of it moved me less than a kind of passion of
pity—that she should be lying alone there in the night,
with no one but a dog beside her. And, yielding to
a sudden impulse, I walked into the chapel.</p>

<p>Never, but never, did I regret an impulse more.</p>

<p>Principe Montughi was standing at the foot of the
bier, his great head sunk between his powerful
shoulders, his strange pale eyes on the white face
between the candles. My own astounded eyes took
him in, the two pieces of a violin bow in the hands
clasped before him, the broken violin between the
paws of the dog lying at his feet. My emotion
flashed into an embarrassment so acute that I could
neither speak nor move. But he did not break out
on me as I expected—as I deserved. He did not
even look at me, at first. And when he did it was as
if I were not there.</p>

<p>“Too late,” he muttered. “Too late. She will
not hear me, now. And when she could I would not
play to her.”</p>

<p>His eyes were stranger and paler than ever. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
the candle light they were like two spots of phosphorescence.
Then they changed. I could see him
slowly search my face, the revolver in my hand, the
night behind me. Something of it was in his eyes
when they came back to my face. Finally he spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Is your wife honest?” he asked.</p>

<p>For very amazement I failed to realise the import
of his question. The scene and the man appalled
me. He had met me a few hours before, with the
same self-possession. He could not long have put
off that grotesque masquerade which secretly amused
me. Yet the Princess must have been already dead,
or dying. I began—I don’t know what I began to
think. Then I suddenly recollected that in Italian
the Prince’s adjective had a particular meaning, as
applied to a woman.</p>

<p>“Is that why you shut her up here?” I burst out
in indignation, in divination.</p>

<p>But I grew humble as he continued to stare at me.
It was as if I could look through his blank eyes into
a place of extremity which was not good to see.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied at last. “That is—she never
would tell me.”</p>

<p>He said it quite simply, gazing down at the proud
white face on the bier with a hypnotic intensity of
demand. It made my anger shrivel away into nothing.
It made me shiver. I saw something dreadful
in the smile just touching the dead woman’s lips—a
smile of Leonardo that was what you chose. But to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
me it was less dreadful than the sighing admission
of the man’s words. They somehow grew up monstrously
before me in the candle-light of the little
painted chapel. They painted for me a picture of
pride more terrifying than anything I had conceived.
Inscrutably they unlocked the tower into which I
had never stepped, peopled the lonely castle, haunted
that fairy aisle of cypresses. Inexorably they
uncovered for me, behind the smiling mask of my
own life, the ghosts of sorrow and defeat, forebodings
blacker and more intolerable still.</p>

<p>The poignancy of that revelation choked me,
blinded me. I staggered back into the dark, leaving
Montughi to take what answer he could from the
mute lips of his Princess.</p>

<p>“How’ll you have it, sir?” asked the barber:
“Wet or dry?”</p>

<p>“It depends,” answered Jerry. “In politics
I’m for the wet. In hair-cuts it’s dry for mine.”</p>

<p>He regarded the mirror not without complacency,
studying the image which he there beheld of a young
man about town and noting incidentally how much
it improved the appearance of the same to be well
cropped.</p>

<p>The barber, a cold man and an assured, met his
eye in the glass:</p>

<p>“I’m with you in politics. But when it comes to
hair-cuts I like a little brilliantine. Your hair seems
to be getting a bit thin, too. How about an application
of Pinaud?”</p>

<p>An application! Jerry shook a bored head. He
knew them of old, these barbers, with their soaps,
their singeings, their powders, their pastes, their
variously perfumed waters, and their endless ingenuities
for parting a customer and his money. The
concluding rites of the occasion were conducted in a
refined silence.</p>

<p>“Will that do, sir?” the barber inquired at length,
throwing off the swathing cloths of his victim. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
show you how it looks.” He produced a hand-glass
which he manipulated in such a way as to reveal to
Jerry the back of his own head.</p>

<p>Jerry saw how it looked. He never had seen it
look that way before. And what he saw disturbingly
diminished his complacency. He therefore distributed
more lavish gratuities than was his wont. Then
he fled, conscious but of two purposes. The first was
to put forever behind him the discoverer of his
shame. The second was to ascertain as quickly as
possible the true facts of his case.</p>

<p>He was not a man, Jerry, greatly given to the mirror.
Not that he was above criticising the effect of a
tie or the cut of a coat. But there were studies
which he pursued more assiduously than that of
Narcissus. When, however, he at last locked himself
into his own room it was with feverish haste
that he seized his shaving-glass and made for the
bureau. He then held the glass on high, tipped it
this way and that, finally caught the right angle.</p>

<p>Yes—he met the cruel confirmation with as bold
a front as he could—it was only too true. There it
was, the Spot, inexorable, vivid, glaring at him like
a malignant eye. There were things in that eye.
There were things—The sensation it gave him was
too absurd.</p>

<p>He tried to laugh it away.</p>

<p>“‘Out, damnëd spot!’” he exclaimed. And he put
the glass down. It was idiotic to be prinking there
like a girl in her first ball-dress. As he walked across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the room, however, he could not resist a temptation
to feel of the place. He began to rummage gingerly
in his hair. The barber was right—he felt a sudden
flash of fury at the fellow!—it was not so thick as it
had been. Yet it felt as it did yesterday, the day
before, the day before that. Could he not be mistaken?
He must take one more look.</p>

<p>He did so, this time adjusting the complicated
reflections more easily. But his adjuration had been
of no avail. Nay, his own touch had deceived him.
The Spot was not out. It was in—very much in. It
was in to stay. It looked at him, whichever way he
turned, like a horrid leering eye. It stared him out
of countenance.</p>

<p>He threw the glass down again and once more
tried persiflage.</p>

<p>“‘Go up, bald-head!’” he jeered at himself, aloud.</p>

<p>It sounded distinctly foolish in the empty room.
The late sunshine pouring in through the windows
made him feel as if someone had caught him making
an ass of himself. He flung himself on the lounge and
proceeded in a detached manner to study the beauties
of the ceiling. As he tilted his head to do so, he
scraped the wall paper. The sudden chill of it against
his scalp made him jump up as if he had been branded.
But the iron did not stop at his skull. It went
on down through him. He could almost hear it
sizzle in his soul.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked with forced philosophy, “it’s
come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Just what had come, he did not for the moment
specify. Perhaps he could not have done so. It was
something very upsetting, though, even if it were
ridiculous; and philosophy didn’t seem to help it
any better than persiflage. And the more he considered
it the nastier it grew. It gradually filled him
with a curious cold pang. It filled the room. He
could not bear it.</p>

<p>“All right,” he growled sardonically, looking for
his hat. “If it won’t ‘out’ by itself, we’ll have to
take it out. It’s too damned stuffy in here.”</p>

<p>He realised the importance of the occasion, as
being his first public appearance in the character of
a bald-headed man. It made him self-conscious and
apologetic. It likewise made him welcome the opportunity
of wearing a hat. For he felt that within-doors,
hereafter, the eyes of men would mockingly
follow him wherever he moved. At the very moment,
however, of stepping into the air his attempted
assurance failed him. An old gentleman happened
to be passing—an old gentleman below the rear of
whose hat brim projected into the light of day a
ludicrous pink half moon. Jerry instinctively,
albeit unobtrusively, sought the corresponding region
of his own person.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he grunted in relief. “I guess we’re not
quite so bad as that—yet a while.”</p>

<p>He resumed his progress a trifle more at ease. But
fatalities beset him. Boys were playing ball in the
street, under horses’ hoofs and in defiance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
police. Most of them were bare-headed. He believed
they did it on purpose to show off their little
polls, how absurdly uniform they were in colour.
A sudden resentment boiled in him against them, as
if he had been the Prophet Elisha; and he yearned to
set bears on them. He would throw in the barber
as the <i>pièce de résistance</i>. That barber! Jerry had
half a mind to go back and—But he dismissed these
low themes from his mind. As he turned the corner,
though, the first thing he beheld was the portrait, on
a bill-board, of a splendid gentleman with Jove-like
locks, waving a majestic hand toward the name of
the preparation which had performed so enviable a
miracle.</p>

<p>“Really,” muttered Jerry to himself, “I must look
those people up. I’m not so far gone, after all. And
at my age—You never can tell.”</p>

<p>Then a motor car went by. There were four persons
in it—two young men and two girls, hatless all.
Jerry’s eyes followed them hopefully. If only they
would justify him! But no Spot was there. The
young people whirled gaily up the Avenue as if the
world belonged to them. And Jerry knew it did.
His heart sank again. The smartness of the car, the
prettiness of the girls, the hilarity and unconcern of
the whole business, smote him like a blow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he thought, “it’s come. And why should
it come to me rather than to them? Are they more
virtuous than I? Are they more learned? Do they
know Gothic architecture from Renaissance? Or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
cosine from an ensign? No. But they have more
hair. Therefore—Q. E. D.!”</p>

<p>This cryptic conclusion, with its somewhat mixed
references, apparently had the effect of guiding
Jerry’s thoughts into more definite channels.
“They,” as he walked, became the burden of his
meditations. They made for him a composite of
eyes grey, blue, black, brown—even the modern
hues of yellow and green; of auburn, chestnut,
bronze, golden, raven, and every other shade of hair
celebrated by poets; of aspects rosy or pale, grave or
smiling, ingenuous or subtle. They were Venuses,
Madonnas, Medeas, Giocondas—the whole gallery
of types most provocative to man. He had always
vaguely expected that one of them—perhaps all of
them: such things were not unknown!—would some
day appear, and—Well, he had never quite settled
what was to happen next. It wouldn’t exactly do
for them to fall on his neck at that stage of the game.
That would cut out too many of the preliminary
thrills incident to these adventures. Neither would
he fall on their neck. It would be too public. They
might not like it. They would probably run away
if he tried. At all events, something very breathless
was to take place. He was to pursue them over land
and sea. He was to endure fire and sword for their
sake. And in the end they were, so to speak, to fall
into his mouth like ripe plums. Or perhaps it
wouldn’t come to anything in the end. Things
didn’t, nowadays. But at least it was going to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
very ravaging for somebody. If it didn’t turn out a
Browning business it might turn out a Tristan and
Isolde affair. And Tristan and Isolde, as a domestic
tableau, were almost more telling than the Brownings.
Or the denouement was to be a noble renunciation,
with moving scenes of parting; and he was
to finish up grandly with an exploded volcano for a
heart.</p>

<p>The only trouble was that he had never yet encountered
“them.” Julia Jenkins, hitherto, had
been his sole approach to them; and whatever else
Julia might be, she certainly was no Venus. Least
of all was she a Madonna, a Medea, or a Gioconda.
And now they, the others, had maddeningly flashed
past him at the one moment in life when he found
himself least disposed to speed after them. For a
bald spot, somehow or other, did not harmonise with
the order of experiences he had been considering.
He inwardly contemplated the spectacle of a gentleman
so afflicted pursuing Beauty o’er moor and fen,
his Spot gleaming pale behind him as he sped; and
Jerry laughed grimly to himself. But there was
more in it than a laugh. Was not Beauty the portion
of every man? And if Fate were so ironical as
to withhold her until Time had shown his tooth,
must she then forever be foresworn? It was too ignoble—the
way tragedy and comedy ran together in
the world. He tried to console himself, for this
chaotic state of affairs, with the volcano: by fancying
that he was already dead to the world. But even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
that failed—unless extinct volcanoes felt as uncomfortable
inside as he did.</p>

<p>“My good fellow,” he admonished himself with
some heat, “you started out to take a walk as a bald-headed
man, and you’d better finish it in that character.
You mistook your rôle; that’s all. Some people
are born to autos and ambrosial locks. Other
people are born to a bald spot and the L. You
imagined you belonged to the former class, but it
turns out you don’t. So the sooner you stop trying
to cover your nakedness with a hat, and the sooner
you take to your predestined conveyance, the less
will you be like a whited sepulchre full of dead men’s
bones.”</p>

<p>In accordance with which principle he removed his
last year’s Panama and made for the nearest Elevated
station. The next instant he realised that only
on impulse could his courage have risen to such a
pitch. He expected that boys would follow him,
hooting; that a mob would collect to point at him
the finger of scorn. But no: the public took it quite
as a matter of course that a young man of his age
and talents should begin to look a little the worse
for wear and should patronise such rapid transit
facilities as were within the means of the proletariat.
They took it so much as a matter of course that
Jerry began to forget his agitation in chagrin. He
even mounted the steps of a station and boarded the
first train without asking himself where he was going.</p>

<p>It was with some surprise that he presently discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
himself to be jolting northward, on a level
with third and fourth storey windows. He found a
certain distraction in glancing into these as he passed.
It appeared to him that on every other sill leaned a
bald-headed man, who gave him a pointed look—as
who should say: “Don’t take it so hard, my poor
young man. You will have company.” They got
on his nerves, those bald-headed apes. Most of them
were in shirt-sleeves, too. He was ready to bestow
the most extravagant admiration upon the Park,
when the train rounded the great curve at 110th
Street. And the arch of the unfinished Cathedral
had a romantically ruinous effect against the incandescent
sky. These things, however, for some
reason reminded him of the young people in the car.
“They’re probably visiting the châteaux of the Loire
by this time,” he reflected. “I wonder how they
like it. This is the kind of travelling we do—we bald-headed
people.” And he relapsed into the volcanic
mood....</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty-fifth Street! All out!”
bawled an unsympathetic conductor.</p>

<p>Jerry got up from his revery with the idea of taking
the next train back. There seemed nothing else to
do—for one born to the L. But when he emerged
into the maze of platforms and tracks and stairways,
he found them so vividly intershot by red rays from
another level of existence that he was moved to
mount to the viaduct. As he did so he mounted into
the climax of a sunset. The glamour of it glorified his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
squalid surroundings. It touched the confusion of
traffic with a glint of romance. It turned the Harlem
into a river of enchantment. Jerry glanced but
coldly about him, however. He thought of the valley
of the Loire. And the sight of an Amsterdam Avenue
trolley running black against the west made him
bend his steps toward that end of the viaduct.</p>

<p>“That’s what we bald-headed people do,” he said
to himself: “We go to Fort George. We then mount
Ferris Wheels and view the landscape o’er. Thus do
we visit the valley of the Loire.” And with that idea
he boarded the next car. But at 181st Street he
changed his mind. The sight of Washington Bridge
suddenly drew him. “Go to,” he thought: “Why
shouldn’t we take in our Loire here and now?” To
which end he sauntered easterly across the little
plaza.</p>

<p>He had not gone far on the bridge before he
stopped. At last he was really caught. The splendour
had died out of the air—the barbaric and obvious
splendour which had failed to move him before.
There was now a warm twilight in which the stream
running deep between its banks, the wooded slopes,
the arches of High Bridge, the slim water-tower,
took on an aspect almost of antiquity. But that and
the mysterious vista beyond—the turn of the river,
the fading haze of roofs, out of which myriads of
lights began to flicker with a brassy pallor—needed
no antiquity to make them extraordinarily picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>Jerry leaned on the parapet and took it in. The
view might have been one he never had seen. This
wonderful valley led to a city he knew naught of.
The strange impression, and the surprise of discovering
a real beauty, led him back in thought to the
city to which he had come from college—how curiously
long ago! He recalled that other impression
of strangeness. Threading in imagination the long
streets that somewhere ran there in the dusk, he
remembered how they looked to him when first he
wandered through them—in search of something to
do. How vast and forbidding their towers had
loomed above him! Would any of them give entrance
to him when he knocked? And which would
be the one? He had knocked at a good many, too.
An amazing number had been oblivious to the honour
of harbouring him. Huge as they were, they
were all jammed to the roof with cheerful busy
superior persons, who naturally had no mind to jam
themselves still tighter at a mere knock from without.
But one of the towers did take him in at last—the
one in Park Row which made an end to his wanderings,
only to send him out on wanderings more
painful still.</p>

<p>He thought of them, looking back into the twilight
that deepened above their sky, as of things almost
impersonal. He thought, too, how different
it had come to seem—being a cheerful busy superior
person in one of the towers! For he had lived
through a reporter’s probation days, had climbed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
last to a desk high above the city, where the city
noises came to him rather musically in their mingling.
But, listening to them year after year, he had never
heard what he always expected he would hear at last—the
sound of his own fame. So many names came
up from the newsboys’ throats, those criers of immortality:
should not his own one day be borne to
him? And for better reasons than gave men the
notoriety of an hour—like falling into a man-hole or
finding a lost jewel? Well, there was no reason—except
that he had never done anything....</p>

<p>“Doing things!” That was another piece of
youth, like the young ladies of his more romantic
moments. He had never been able very narrowly
to define them, the things. In that case he probably
would have done them. But they were of a highly
decorative order. They were also to prove of inestimable
benefit to the World at large—with a large
W. And the World’s gratitude, incidentally, would
enable him to retire to private life on the proceeds.
After which there would be an appropriate tablet up
there in the Hall of Fame, and a column or two in
future encyclopædias. Whereas now—</p>

<p>With the very impulse to smile indulgently at himself,
there flashed on Jerry for the first time in his
life the full sense of what it meant. For if he could
smile at his youth and the vanities of his youth, it
was because his youth was gone. And that was no
smiling matter. That was what had hung over him
all the afternoon. That was what he had been trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
to get away from. But now he had to face it. It
was all very well to tell himself that he was a fool to
get into such a state for so preposterous a reason;
that his calamity was by no means unique in the
world; that he was not so old after all. The fact
remained that his youth, his <i>première jeunesse</i>, his
golden hour, was done for.</p>

<p>The sudden realisation of it filled him with a passionate
bitterness. What under the sun had he been
thinking of, that he had not seen that priceless thing
slipping through his fingers? Where had it gone?
What had he done with it? What had he to show
for it? It seemed to him that the darkness which
fell while his thoughts were turning in this hopeless
round was symbolic of an obscurity that for him had
crept into the sunlight of the earth. And the things
he had lost were as fairylike and unattainable as the
magic city glittering there in the distance, above
those shadowy arches printed against a river of gold.</p>

<p>He scrambled to the parapet and sat staring down
into the underlying chasm. The twinkle of the
Speedway and the jewelry of the opposite switches
just made visible the water between. How black it
was, and how noiseless—like another Lethe! The
word hung in his mind as it came back to him how
casually one step had followed another this afternoon,
yet how irresistibly, as if foreordained. And
one step more would take him into oblivion....
After all, why not? Wouldn’t it be logical? Had he
any real reason for turning around and going back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
to life—save sheer cowardice? The accepted reasons
had always struck him as being childish attempts to
decorate a raw animal impulse. If you faced the
thing honestly, what was life, anyway, after the
climacteric of youth? Nothing but a long drawn out
decay of the body, a gradual dulling of the senses,
an imperceptible slackening of the will—a slower
and more humiliating death. For a man with someone
to live for or something to create, it might be
different. But for him—</p>

<p>“Well, Buddy,” uttered a cheerful voice behind
him: “Thinkin’ o’ jumpin’ overboard?”</p>

<p>Jerry did jump, but not in the direction indicated;
and his fingers caught instinctively at the inner edge
of the parapet. In the dim light he discovered his
interlocutor to be a policeman, built in the generous
proportions of his kind and of the age that has
yielded to the elderly spread.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be doing very much to stop
it,” Jerry replied without hauteur.</p>

<p>“Looks that way, don’t it?” returned the guardian
of the law genially, leaning with elbows on the parapet.
“But you see if you really want to go, you’ll
go; an’ if you don’t there ain’t no reason in natur’
why you shouldn’t enjoy yourself kickin’ your heels
over Harlem Speedway. That’s how it strikes me.
Only if you do go over, just do me the favour not to
pick the road. You’d be surprised to see what a
mess you’d make.”</p>

<p>Jerry, considering this view of his liberty, gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
attention to a train which swept in a blur of light
down the opposite bank. As for the policeman, he
gave his attention to Jerry:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Has she given you the go-by?”</p>

<p>“No” declared Jerry, with a shade of emphasis.</p>

<p>“Been fired from your job then, I s’pose,” pursued
he of the helmet, in the accent of one acquainted
with disasters more calamitous than those of the
heart.</p>

<p>“Not that I’ve heard of,” rejoined Jerry.</p>

<p>The policeman took off his helmet and laid it on
the parapet beside him.</p>

<p>“Pleasant way to spend an evenin’, ain’t it?” he
said. “You make up your mind just how you’ll go,
when you get good and ready. An’ then you wonder
who’ll find you first, an’ whether they’ll take you to
the hospital or the morgue, an’ what a time they’ll
have figurin’ out who the devil you are, an’ how blue
your folks’ll be, an’ how they’ll wish they’d given
you that horse-shoe stickpin for Christmas, an’ how
your girl’ll go on, an’ all. O there ain’t nothin’ like
it for passin’ the time.”</p>

<p>“Say” demanded Jerry, turning upon his companion
with some loftiness, “where do you get that
stuff?”</p>

<p>“Why? Do you smell it?” asked the policeman.
He ran the powerful hand of the law through a grizzled
pompadour.</p>

<p>“N-no,” returned Jerry slowly, eyeing this operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
not without interest. “You don’t mean to say
that any of your hair ever came out, do you?”</p>

<p>“Huh-huh.” The policeman’s singsong betrayed
no surprise at this abrupt turn of the conversation.
“It started droppin’ like leaves in the fall o’ the year,
when I was about as young as you.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” inquired Jerry, not displeased,
a little incredulous, and now unfeignedly interested.</p>

<p>“Why I used oil, if you want a straight tip—just
plain castor oil. It’s twice as good as them high-falutin
fixin’s they soak you for in barber shops. It
don’t spoil your pillow, neither. But the missus,”
he added on reflection, “she says a bald spot’s worse
inside the bean than out, an’ there ain’t no oil’ll
help it.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite an idea,” commented Jerry elusively.
He leaned back, as if to reconnoitre the field of ideas.</p>

<p>The policeman accepted this tribute of respect.
Then he replaced his helmet on his well-covered
crown and stuck his billy under his arm.</p>

<p>“Listen, Bud,” he announced confidentially: “I
got another idea. Do you happen to have as much
as a dollar or so about you?”</p>

<p>“I do,” admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” continued the policeman. “Now
what do you say we go over to a place I know an’
let me treat you to a shot o’ somethin’ wet? My old
woman gives me hell if I hold anythin’ out on her,
an’——”</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Jerry.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The first of the two boats to arrive at this unappointed
rendezvous was one to catch the eye
even in that river of strange craft. She had
neither the raking bow nor the rising poop of the
local <i>mehala</i>, but a tall incurving beak, not unlike
those of certain Mesopotamian sculptures, with a
windowed and curtained deck-house at the stern.
Forward she carried a short mast. The lateen sail
was furled, however, and the galley was propelled at
a fairly good gait by seven pairs of long sweeps.
They flashed none too rhythmically, it must be added,
at the sun which had just risen above the Persian
mountains. And although the slit sleeves of the
fourteen oarsmen, all of them young and none of
them ill to look upon, flapped decoratively enough
about the handles of the sweeps, they could not be
said to present a shipshape appearance. Neither did
the black felt caps the boatmen wore, fantastically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
tall and knotted about their heads with gay fringed
scarves.</p>

<p>This barge had passed out of the Ab-i-Diz and was
making its stately enough way across the basin of
divided waters below Bund-i-Kir, when from the
mouth of the Ab-i-Gerger—the easterly of two turbid
threads into which the Karun above this point is
split by a long island—there shot a trim white motor-boat.
The noise she made in the breathless summer sunrise,
intensified and re-echoed by the high clay banks
which here rise thirty feet or more above the water,
caused the rowers of the galley to look around. Then
they dropped their sweeps in astonishment at the
spectacle of the small boat advancing so rapidly toward
them without any effort on the part of the four
men it contained, as if blown by the breath of jinn.
The word <i>Firengi</i>, however, passed around the deck—that
word so flattering to a great race, which once
meant Frank but which now, in one form or another,
describes for the people of western Asia the people
of Europe and their cousins beyond the seas. Among
the friends of the jinn, of whom as it happened only
two were Europeans, there also passed an explanatory
word. But although they pronounced the strange
oarsmen to be Lurs, they caused their jinni to cease
his panting, so struck were they by the appearance
of the high-beaked barge.</p>

<p>The two craft drifted abreast of each other about
midway of the sunken basin. As they did so, one of
the Europeans in the motor-boat, a stocky black-moustached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
fellow in blue overalls, wearing in place
of the regulation helmet of that climate a greasy
black <i>beret</i> over one ear, lifted his hand from the
wheel and called out the Arabic salutation of the
country:</p>

<p>“Peace be unto you!”</p>

<p>“And to you, peace!” responded a deep voice from
the doorway of the deck-house. It was evident that
the utterer of this friendly antiphon was not a Lur.
Fairer, taller, stouter, and older than his wild-looking
crew, he was also better dressed—in a girdled robe of
grey silk, with a striped silk scarf covering his hair
and the back of his neck in the manner of the Arabs.
A thick brown beard made his appearance more imposing,
while two scars across his left cheek, emerging
from the beard, suggested or added to something in
him which might on occasion become formidable.
As it was he stepped forward with a bow and addressed
a slim young man who sat in the stern of the
motor-boat. “Shall we pass as Kinglake and the
Englishman of <i>Eothen</i> did in the desert,” asked the
stranger, smiling, in a very good English, “because
they had not been introduced? Or will you do me the
honour to come on board my—ark?”</p>

<p>The slim young man, whose fair hair, smooth face,
and white clothes made him the most boyish looking
of that curious company, lifted his white helmet and
smiled in return.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he assented. And, becoming conscious
that his examination of this surprising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
stranger, who looked down at him with odd light
eyes, was too near a stare, he added: “What on
earth is your ark made of, Mr. Noah?”</p>

<p>What she was made of, as a matter of fact, was
what heightened the effect of remoteness she produced—a
hard dark wood unknown to the lower
Karun, cut in lengths of not more than two or three
feet and caulked with reeds and mud.</p>

<p>“‘Make thee an ark of gopher wood,’” quoted the
stranger. “‘Rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and
thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.’”</p>

<p>“Bitumen, eh?” exclaimed the slim young man.
“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Do you ask, you who drill oil at Meidan-i-Naft?”</p>

<p>“As it happens, I don’t!” smiled the slim young
man.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” continued the stranger, after a
scarcely perceptible pause, “let me welcome you on
board the Ark.” And when the unseen jinni had
made it possible for the slim young man to set foot
on the deck of the barge, the stranger added, with a
bow: “Magin is my name—from Brazil.”</p>

<p>If the slim young man did not stare again, he at
least had time to make out that the oddity of his
host’s light eyes lay not so much in the fact of their
failing to be distinctly brown, grey, or green, as that
they had a translucent look. Then he responded
briefly, holding out his hand:</p>

<p>“Matthews. But isn’t this a long way from Rio
de Janeiro?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” returned the other, “it’s not so near London!
But come in and have something, won’t you?”
And he held aside the reed portière that screened the
door of the deck-house.</p>

<p>“My word! You do know how to do yourself!”
exclaimed Matthews. His eye took in the Kerman
embroidery on the table in the centre of the small
saloon, the gazelle skins and silky Shiraz rugs covering
the two divans at the sides, the fine Sumak carpet
on the floor, and the lion pelt in front of an inner
door. “By Jove!” he exclaimed again. “That’s a
beauty!”</p>

<p>“Ha!” laughed the Brazilian. “The Englishman
spies his lion first!”</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?” asked Matthews,
going behind the table for a better look. “They’re
getting few and far between around here, they say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they still turn up,” answered the Brazilian,
it seemed to Matthews not too definitely. Before he
could pursue the question farther, Magin clapped his
hands. Instantly there appeared at the outer door
a barefooted Lur, whose extraordinary cap looked to
Matthews even taller and more pontifical than those
of his fellow-countrymen at the oars. The Lur, his
hands crossed on his girdle, received a rapid order
and vanished as silently as he came.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew the lingo like that!” commented
Matthews.</p>

<p>Magin waved a deprecatory hand.</p>

<p>“One picks it up soon enough. Besides, what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
the use—with a man like yours? Who is he, by the
way? He doesn’t look English.”</p>

<p>“Who? Gaston? He isn’t. He’s French. And
he doesn’t know too much of the lingo. But the
blighter could get on anywhere. He’s lived all over
the place—Algiers, Egypt, Baghdad. He’s been
chauffeur to more nabobs in turbans than you can
count. He’s a topping mechanic, too. The wheel
hasn’t been invented that beggar can’t make go
’round. The only trouble he has is with his own.
He keeps time for a year or two, and then something
happens to his mainspring and he gets the sack. But
he never seems to go home. He always moves on to
some place where it’s hotter and dirtier. You should
hear his stories! He’s an amusing devil.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps not so different from the rest of us!”
threw out Magin. “What flea bites us? Why do
you come here, courting destruction in a cockleshell
that may any minute split on a rock and spill you to
the sharks, when you might be punting some pretty
girl up the backwaters of the Thames? Why do I
float around in this old ark of reeds and bulrushes,
like an elderly Moses in search of a promised land,
who should be at home wearing the slippers of middle
age? What is it? A sunstroke? This is hardly
the country where Goethe’s citrons bloom!”</p>

<p>“Damned if I know!” laughed Matthews. “I
fancy we like a bit of a lark!”</p>

<p>The Brazilian laughed too.</p>

<p>“A bit of a lark!” he echoed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Just then the silent Lur reappeared with a tray.</p>

<p>“I say!” protested Matthews. “Whiskey and
soda at five o’clock in the morning, in the middle of
July——”</p>

<p>“1914, if you must be so precise!” added Magin
jovially. “But why not?” he demanded. “Aren’t
you an Englishman? You mustn’t shake the pious
belief in which I was brought up, that you are all
weaned with Scotch! Say when. It isn’t every day
that I have the pleasure of so fortunate an encounter.”
And, rising, he lifted his glass, bowed, and
said: “Here’s to a bit of a lark, Mr. Matthews!”</p>

<p>The younger man rose to it. But inwardly he began
to feel a little irked.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he asked, nibbling at a biscuit,
“can you tell me anything about the Ab-i-Diz? I
dare say you must know something about it—since
your men look as if they came from up that way. Is
there a decent channel as far as Dizful?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” uttered Magin slowly. “Are you thinking
of going up there?” He considered the question, and
his guest, with a flicker in his lighted eyes. “Well,
decent is a relative word, you know. However,
wonders can be accomplished with a stout rope and
a gang of natives, even beyond Dizful. But here you
see me and my ark still whole—after a night journey,
too. The worst thing is the sun. You see I am more
careful of my skin than you. As for the shoals, the
rapids, the sharks, the lions, the nomads who pop at
you from the bank, <i>et cetera</i>—you are an Englishman!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
Do you take an interest in antiques?” he broke off
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes—though interest is a relative word too, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Quite so!” agreed the Brazilian. “I have rather
a mania for that sort of thing, myself. Wait. Let
me show you.” And he went into the inner cabin.
When he came back he held up an alabaster cup. “A
Greek kylix!” he cried. “Pure Greek! What an
outline, eh? This is what keeps me from putting on
my slippers! I have no doubt Alexander left it behind
him. Perhaps Hephaistion drank out of it, or
Nearchus, to celebrate his return from India. And
some rascally Persian stole it out of a tent!”</p>

<p>Matthews, taking the cup, saw the flicker brighten
in the Brazilian’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Nice little pattern of grape leaves, that,” he said.
“And think of picking it up out here!”</p>

<p>“Oh you can always pick things up, if you know
where to look,” said Magin. “Dieulafoy and the
rest of them didn’t take everything. How could they?
The people who have come and gone through this
country of Elam! Why just over there, at Bund-i-Kir,
Antigonus fought Eumenes and the Silver
Shields for the spoils of Susa—and won them! I
have discovered——But come in here.” And he
pushed wider open the door of the inner cabin.</p>

<p>Matthews stepped into what was evidently a stateroom.
A broad bunk filled one side of it, and the
visitor could not help remarking a second interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
door. But his eye was chiefly struck by two, three,
no four, chests, which took up more space in the narrow
cabin than could be convenient for its occupant.
They seemed to be made of the same mysterious
dark wood as the “ark,” clamped with copper.</p>

<p>“I say! Those aren’t bad!” he exclaimed. “More
of the spoils of Susa?”</p>

<p>“Ho! My trunks? I had them made up the river,
like the rest. But I wonder what would interest you
in my museum. Let’s see.” He bent over one of the
chests, unlocked it, rummaged under the cover, and
brought out a broad metal circlet which he handed
to Matthews. “How would that do for a crown,
eh?”</p>

<p>The young man took it over to the porthole. The
metal, he then saw, was a soft antique gold, wrought
into a decoration of delicate spindles, with a border
of filigree. The circlet was beautiful in itself, and
astonishingly heavy. But what it chiefly did for
Matthews was to sharpen the sense of strangeness,
of remoteness, which this bizarre galley, come from
unknown waters, had brought into the familiar muddy
Karun.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” went on the Brazilian, “it’s
an anklet. But can you make it out? Those spindles
are Persian, while the filigree is more Byzantine than
anything else. You find funny things up there, in
caves——”</p>

<p>He tossed a vague hand, into which Matthews put
the anklet, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>“Take it before I steal it!”</p>

<p>“Keep it, won’t you?” proposed the astonishing
Brazilian.</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks. But I could hardly do that,” Matthews
replied.</p>

<p>“Why not?” protested Magin. “As a souvenir of
a pleasant meeting! I have a ton of them.” He
waved his hand at the chests.</p>

<p>“No, really, thanks,” persisted the young man.
“And I’m afraid we must be getting on. I don’t
know the river, you see, and I’d like to reach Dizful
before dark.”</p>

<p>The Brazilian studied him a moment.</p>

<p>“As you say,” he finally conceded. “But you will
at least have another drink before you go?”</p>

<p>“No, not even that, thanks,” said Matthews.
“We really must be off. But it’s been very decent
of you.”</p>

<p>He felt both awkward and amused as he backed
out to the deck, followed by his imposing host. At
sight of the two the crew scattered to their oars.
They had been leaning over the side, absorbed in
admiration of the white jinn-boat. Matthews’s Persian
servant handed up to Magin’s butler a tray of
tea glasses—on which Matthews also noted a bottle.
In honour of that bottle Gaston himself stood up and
took off his greasy cap.</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks, Monsieur,” he said. “I
have tasted nothing so good since I left France.”</p>

<p>“In that case, my friend,” rejoined Magin in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
French as good as his English, “it is time you returned!”
And he abounded in amiable speeches
and ceremonious bows until the last <i>au revoir</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Au plaisir!</i>” called back Gaston, having invoked
his jinni. Then, after a last look at the barge, he
asked over his shoulder in a low voice: “Who is
this extraordinary type, M’sieu Guy? A species of
an Arab, who speaks French and English and who
voyages in a galley from a museum!”</p>

<p>“A Brazilian, he says,” imparted M’sieu Guy—whose
surname was beyond Gaston’s Gallic tongue.</p>

<p>“Ah! The uncle of America! That understands
itself! He sent me out a cognac, too! And did he
present you to his <i>dame de compagnie</i>? She put her
head out of a porthole to look at our boat. A Lur,
like the others, but with a pair of blistering black
eyes! And a jewel in her nose!”</p>

<p>“It takes you, Gaston,” said Guy Matthews, “to
discover a dame of company!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When the white motor-boat had disappeared in
the glitter of the Ab-i-Diz, Senhor Magin, not unlike
other fallible human beings when released from the
necessity of keeping up a pitch, appeared to lose
something of his gracious humour. So, it transpired,
did his decorative boatmen, who had not expected to
row twenty-five miles upstream at a time when most
people in that climate seek the relief of their <i>serdabs</i>—which
are underground chambers cooled by running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
water, it may be, and by a tall <i>badgir</i>, or air
chimney. The running water, to be sure, was here,
and had already begun to carry the barge down the
Karun. If the high banks of that tawny stream constituted
a species of air chimney, however, such air
as moved therein was not calculated for relief. But
when Brazilians command, even a Lur may obey.
These Lurs, at all events, propelled their galley back
to the basin of Bund-i-Kir, and on into the Ab-i-Shuteit—which
is the westerly of those two halves
of the Karun. Before nightfall the barge had reached
the point where navigation ends. There Magin sent
his majordomo ashore to procure mounts. And at
sunset the two of them, followed by a horse-boy, rode
northward six or seven miles, till the city of Shustar
rose dark above them in the summer evening, on its
rock that cleaves the Karun in two.</p>

<p>The Bazaar by which they entered the town was
deserted at that hour, save by dogs that set up a terrific
barking at the sight of strangers. Here the
<i>charvadar</i> lighted a vast white linen lantern, which he
proceeded to carry in front of the two riders. He
seemed to know where he was going, for he led the
way without a pause through long blank silent streets
of indescribable filth and smells. The gloom of them
was deepened by jutting balconies, and by innumerable
<i>badgirs</i> that cut out a strange black fretwork
against amazing stars. At last the three stopped in
front of a gate in the vicinity of the citadel. This
was not one of the gateways that separate the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
quarters of Shustar, but a door in a wall, recessed
in a tall arch and ornamented with an extraordinary
variety of iron clamps, knobs, locks, and
knockers.</p>

<p>Of one of the latter the <i>charvadar</i> made repeated
use, until someone shouted from inside. The horse-boy
shouted back, and presently his lantern caught
a glitter of two eyes in a slit. The eyes belonged to
a cautious doorkeeper, who after satisfying himself
that the visitors were not enemies admitted the
Brazilian and the Lur into a vaulted brick vestibule.
Then, having looked to his wards and bolts, he
lighted Magin through a corridor which turned into
a low tunnel-like passage. This led into a sort of
cloister, where a covered ambulatory surrounded a
dark pool of stars. Thence another passage brought
them out into a great open court. Here an invisible
jet of water made an illusion of coolness in another,
larger, pool, overlooked by a portico of tall slim pillars.
Between them Magin caught the glow of a
cigar.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Ganz,” his bass voice called from
the court.</p>

<p>“Heaven! Is that you?” replied the smoker of
the cigar. “What are you doing here, in God’s
name? I imagined you at Mohamera, by this time,
or even in the Gulf.” This remark, it may not be
irrelevant to say, was in German—as spoken in the
trim town of Zurich.</p>

<p>“And so I should have been,” replied the polyglot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
Magin in the same language, mounting the steps of
the portico and shaking his friend’s hand, “but for—all
sorts of things. If we ran aground once, we ran
aground three thousand times. I begin to wonder
if we shall get through the reefs at Ahwaz—with all
the rubbish I have on board.”</p>

<p>“Ah, bah! You can manage, going down. But
why do you waste your time in Shustar, with all that
is going on in Europe?”</p>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Magin. “What is going on in
Europe? A great family is wearing well cut mourning,
and a small family is beginning to turn green!
How does that affect two quiet nomads in Elam—especially
when one of them is a Swiss and one a
Brazilian?” He laughed, and lighted a cigar the
other offered him. “My dear Ganz, it is an enigma
to me how a man who can listen to such a fountain,
and admire such stars, can perpetually sigh after the
absurdities of Europe! Which reminds me that I
met an Englishman this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that? Are Englishmen so rare?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no—though I notice, my good Ganz, that
you do your best to thin them out! This specimen
was too typical for me to be able to describe him.
Younger than usual, possibly; yellow hair, blue eyes,
constrained manner, everything to sample. He called
himself Mark, or Matthew. Rather their apostolic
air, too—except that he was in the Oil Company’s
motor-boat. But he gave me to understand that he
was not in the Oil Company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“I saw for myself that he knows nothing about
archæology. Who is he? Lynch? Bank? Telegraph?”</p>

<p>“He’s not Lynch, and he’s not Bank, and he’s not
Telegraph. Neither is he consul, or even that famous
railroad. He’s—English!” And Ganz let out a
chuckle at the success of his own characterisation.</p>

<p>“Ah! So?” exclaimed Magin elaborately. “I
hear, by the way, that that famous railroad is not
marching so fast. The Lurs don’t like it. But sometimes
even Englishmen,” he added, “have reasons
for doing what they do. This one, at any rate,
seemed more inclined to ask questions than to answer
them. I confess I don’t know whether it was
because he had nothing to say or whether he preferred
not to say it. Is he perhaps a Son of Papa, making
the grand tour?”</p>

<p>“More or less. Papa gave him no great letter of
credit, though. He came out to visit some of the Oil
people. And he’s been here long enough to learn
quite a lot of Persian.”</p>

<p>“So he starts this morning, I take it, from Sheleilieh.
But why the devil does he go to Dizful, by
himself?”</p>

<p>“And why the devil shouldn’t he? He’s out here,
and he wants to see the sights—such as they are. So
he’s going to take a look at the ruins of Susa, and at
your wonderful unspoiled Dizful. Shir Ali Khan
will be delighted to get a few <i>tomans</i> for his empty
house by the river. Then the 21st, you know, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
coronation. So I gave him a letter to the Father of
Swords, who——”</p>

<p>“Thunder and lightning!” Magin’s heavy voice
resounded in the portico very like a bellow. “You,
Ganz, sent this man to the Father of Swords? He
might be one of those lieutenants from India who go
smelling around in their holidays, so pink and innocent!”</p>

<p>“What is that to me?” demanded the Swiss,
raising his own voice. “Or to you either? After all,
Senhor Magin, are you the Emperor of Elam?”</p>

<p>The Brazilian laughed.</p>

<p>“Not yet! And naturally it’s nothing to you,
when you cash him cheques and sell him tinned cows
and quinine. But for a man who perpetually sighs
after Europe, Herr Ganz, and for a Swiss of the North,
you strike me as betraying a singular lack of sensibility
to certain larger interests of your race. However—What
concerns me is that you should have
confided to this young man, with such a roll of sentimental
eyes as I can imagine, that Dizful is still
‘unspoiled’! If Dizful is unspoiled, he might spoil it.
I’ve found some very nice things up there, you know.
I was even fool enough to show him one or two.”</p>

<p>“Bah! He likes to play tennis and shoot! You
know these English boys.”</p>

<p>Magin considered those English boys in silence for
a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know them. This one told me he liked a
bit of a lark! I know myself what a lark it is to navigate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
the Ab-i-Diz, at the end of July! But what is
most curious about these English boys is that when
they go out for a bit of a lark they come home with
Egypt or India in their pocket. Have you noticed
that, Ganz? That’s their idea of a bit of a lark.
And with it all they are still children. What can one
do with such people? A bit of a lark! Well, you will
perhaps make me a little annoyance, Mr. Adolf Ganz,
by sending your English boy up to Dizful to have a
bit of a lark. However, he’ll either give himself a
sunstroke or get himself bitten in two by a shark.
He asked me about the channel, and I had an inspiration.
I told him he would have no trouble. So
he’ll go full speed and we shall see what we shall see.
Do you sell coffins, Mr. Ganz, in addition to all your
other valuable merchandise?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, Mr. Magin,” replied the Swiss. “Do
you need one? But you haven’t explained to me yet
why you give me the pain of saying good-bye to you
a second time.”</p>

<p>“Partly, Mr. Ganz, because I am tired of sleeping
in an oven, and partly because I—the Father of
Swords has asked me to run up to Bala Bala before
I leave. But principally because I need a case or
two more of your excellent <i>vin de champagne</i>—manufactured
out of Persian petroleum, the water of the
Karun, the nameless abominations of Shustar, and
the ever effervescing impudence of the Swiss Republic!”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” smiled the flattered author of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
this concoction. “I have to use what I can get, in
this God-forsaken place.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you will end by getting a million,
eh?”</p>

<p>“No such luck! But I’m getting a piano. Did I
tell you? A Blüthner. It’s already on the way up
from Mohamera.”</p>

<p>“A Blüthner! In Shustar! God in heaven! Why
did you wait until I had gone?”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you still here?” The fact of Magin’s
being still there, so unexpectedly, hung in his mind.
“By the way, speaking of the Father of Swords, did
you give him an order?”</p>

<p>“I gave him an order. Didn’t you pay it?”</p>

<p>“I thought twice about it. For unless you have
struck oil, up in that country of yours where nobody
goes, or gold——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Adolf Ganz,” remarked the Brazilian with
some pointedness, “all I ask of you is to respect my
signature and to keep closed that many-tongued
mouth of yours. I sometimes fear that in you the
banker is inclined to exchange confidences with the
chemist—or even with the Son of Papa who cashes
a cheque. Eh?”</p>

<p>Ganz cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he rejoined, “all you have to do is
to ask him, when you meet him again at Bala Bala.
And the English bank will no doubt be happy to accept
the transfer of your account.”</p>

<p>Magin began to chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“We assert our dignity? Never mind, Adolf. As
a matter of fact I have a high opinion of your discretion—so
high that when I found the Imperial Bank
of Elam I shall put you in charge of it! And you did
me a real service by sending that motor-boat across
my bow this morning. For in it I discovered just the
chauffeur I have been looking for. I am getting tired
of my galley, you know. You will see something
when I come back.”</p>

<p>“But,” Ganz asked after a moment, “do you
really expect to come back?”</p>

<p>“But what else should I do? End my days sneezing
and sniffling by some polite lake of Zurich like
you, my poor Ganz, when you find in your hand the
magic key that might unlock for you any door in the
world? That, for example, is not my idea of a lark,
as your Son of Papa would say! Men are astounding
animals, I admit. But I never could live in Europe,
where you can’t turn around without stepping on
someone else’s toes. I want room! I want air! I
want light! And for a collector, you know, America
is after all a little bare. While here——!”</p>

<p>“O God!” cried Adolf Ganz out of his dark Persian
portico.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>As Gaston very truly observed, there are moments
in Persia when even the most experienced chauffeur
is capable of an emotion. And an unusual number
of such moments enlivened for Gaston and his companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
their journey up the Ab-i-Diz. Indeed
Matthews asked himself more than once why he had
chosen so doubtful a road to Dizful, when he might
so much more easily have ridden there, and at night.
It certainly was not beautiful, that river of brass
zigzagging out of sight of its empty hinterland. Very
seldom did anything so visible as a palm lift itself
against the blinding Persian blue. Konar trees were
commoner, their dense round masses sometimes shading
a white-washed tomb or a black tent. Once or
twice at sight of the motor-boat a <i>bellam</i>, a native
canoe, took refuge in the mouth of one of the gullies
that scarred the bank like sun-cracks. Generally,
however, there was nothing to be seen between the
water and the sky but two yellow walls of clay,
topped by endless thickets of tamarisk and nameless
scrub. Matthews wondered, disappointed, whether
a jungle looked like that, and if some black-maned
lion walked more softly in it, or slept less soundly,
hearing the pant of the unknown creature in the
river. But there was no lack of more immediate
lions in the path. The sun, for one thing, as the
Brazilian had predicted, proved a torment against
which double awnings faced with green were of small
avail. Then the treacheries of a crooked and constantly
shallowing channel needed all the attention
the travellers could spare. And the rapids of Kaleh
Bunder, where a rocky island flanked by two reefs
threatened to bar any further progress, afforded the
liveliest moments of their day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>The end of that day, nevertheless, found our sight-seer
smoking cigarettes in Shir Ali Khan’s garden at
Dizful and listening to the camel bells that jingled
from the direction of certain tall black pointed arches
straddling the dark river. When Matthews looked
at those arches by sunlight, and at the queer old flat-topped
yellow town visible through them, he regretted
that he had made up his mind to continue his
journey so soon. However, he was coming back. So
he packed off Gaston and the Bakhtiari to Sheleilieh,
where they and their motor-boat belonged.
And he himself, with his servant Abbas and the <i>charvadar</i>
of whom they hired horses, set out at nightfall
for the mountain citadel of Bala Bala. For there
the great Salman Taki Khan, chieftain of the lower
Lurs, otherwise known as the Father of Swords, was
to celebrate as became a redoubtable vassal of a remote
and youthful suzerain the coronation of Ahmed
Shah Kajar.</p>

<p>It was nearly morning again when, after a last
scramble up a trough of rocks and gravel too steep
for riding, the small cavalcade reached a plateau in
the shadow of still loftier elevations. Here they
were greeted by a furious barking of dogs. Indeed it
quickly became necessary to organise a defence of
whips and stones against the guardians of that
high terrace. The uproar soon brought a shout out
of the darkness. The <i>charvadar</i> shouted back, and
after a long-distance colloquy there appeared a figure
crowned by the tall <i>kola</i> of the Brazilian’s boatmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
who drove the dogs away. The dialect in which he
spoke proved incomprehensible to Matthews. Luckily
it was not altogether so to Abbas, that underling
long resigned to the eccentricities of the <i>Firengi</i>,
whose accomplishments included even a sketchy
knowledge of his master’s tongue. It appeared that
the law of Bala Bala forbade the door of the Father
of Swords to open before sunrise. But the tall-hatted
one offered the visitor the provisional hospitality of
a black tent, of a refreshing drink of goats’ buttermilk,
and of a comfortable felt whereon to stretch
cramped legs.</p>

<p>When Matthews returned to consciousness he first
became aware of a blinding oblong of light in the dark
wall of the tent. He then made out a circle of pontifical
black hats, staring at him, his fair hair, and
his indecently close-fitting clothes, in the silence of
unutterable curiosity. It made him think, for a bewildered
instant, that he was back on the barge he
had met in the river. As for the black hats, what
astonished them not least was the stranger’s immediate
demand for water, and his evident dissatisfaction
with the quantity of it they brought him. There
happily proved to be no lack of this commodity, as
Matthews’ ears had told him. He was not long in
pursuing the sound into the open, where he found
himself at the edge of a village of black tents, pitched
in a grassy hollow between two heights. The nearer
and lower was a detached cone of rock, crowned by
a rude castle. The other peak, not quite so precipitous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
afforded foothold for scattered scrub oaks and
for a host of slowly moving sheep and goats. Between
them the plateau looked down on two sides
into two converging valleys. And the clear air was
full of the noise of a brook that cascaded between the
scrub oaks of the higher mountain, raced past the
tents, and plunged out of sight in the narrower
gorge.</p>

<p>“Ripping!” pronounced Matthews genially to his
black-hatted gallery.</p>

<p>He was less genial about the persistence of the gallery,
rapidly increased by recruits from the black
tents, in dogging him through every detail of his
toilet. But he was rescued at last by Abbas and an
old Lur who, putting his two hands to the edge of his
black cap, saluted him in the name of the Father of
Swords. The Lur then led the way to a trail that
zigzagged up the lower part of the rocky cone. He
explained the quantity of loose boulders obstructing
the path by saying that they had been left there to
roll down on whomever should visit the Father of
Swords without an invitation. That such an enterprise
would not be too simple became more evident
when the path turned into a cave. Here another Lur
was waiting with candles. He gave one each to the
newcomers, leading the way to a low door in the rock.
This was opened by an individual in a long red coat
of ceremony, carrying a heavy silver mace, who gave
Matthews the customary salutation of peace and
bowed him into an irregular court. An infinity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
doors opened out of it—chiefly of the stables, the old
man said, pointing out a big white mule or two of the
famous breed of Bala Bala. Thence the visitor was
led up a steep stone stair to a terrace giving entrance
upon a corridor and another, narrower, stone stair.
From its prodigiously high steps he emerged into a
hall, carpeted with felt. At this point, the Lurs took
off their shoes. Matthews followed suit, being then
ushered into what was evidently a room of state. It
contained no furniture, to be sure, save for the handsome
rugs on the floor. The room did not look bare,
however, for its lines were broken by a deep alcove,
and by a continuous succession of niches. Between
and about the niches the walls were decorated with
plaster reliefs of flowers and arabesques. Matthews
wondered if the black hats were capable of that! But
what chiefly caught his eye was the terrace opening
out of the room, and the stupendous view.</p>

<p>The terrace hung over a green chasm where the
two converging gorges met at the foot of the crag of
Bala Bala. Matthews looked down as from the prow
of a ship into the tumbled country below him,
through which a river flashed sinuously toward the
faraway haze of the plains. The sound of water
filling the still clear air, the brilliance of the morning
light, the wildness and remoteness of that mountain
eyrie, so different from anything he had yet seen,
added a last strangeness to the impressions of which
the young man had been having so many.</p>

<p>“What a pity to spoil it with a railroad!” he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
not help thinking, as he leaned over the parapet of
the terrace.</p>

<p>“Sahib!” suddenly whispered Abbas behind him.</p>

<p>Matthews turned, and saw in the doorway of the
terrace a personage who could be none other than his
host. In place of the <i>kola</i> of his people this personage
wore a great white turban, touched with gold. The
loose blue <i>aba</i> enveloping his ample figure was also
embroidered with gold. Not the least striking detail
of his appearance, however, was his beard, which had
a pronounced tendency toward scarlet. His nails
were likewise reddened with henna, reminding Matthews
that the hands belonging to the nails were
rumoured to bear even more sinister stains. And the
bottomless black eyes peering out from under the
white turban lent surprising credibility to such rumours.
But there was no lack of graciousness in the
gestures with which those famous hands saluted the
visitor and pointed him to a seat of honour on the
rug beside the Father of Swords. The Father of
Swords furthermore pronounced his heart uplifted
to receive a friend of Ganz Sahib, that prince among
the merchants of Shustar. Yet he did not hesitate
to express a certain surprise at discovering in the
friend of the prince among the merchants of Shustar
one still in the flower of youth, who exhibited at the
same time the features of good fortune and the lineaments
of prudence. And he inquired as to what sorrow
had led one so young to fold the carpet of enjoyment
and to wander so far from his parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>Matthews, disdaining the promptings of Abbas—who
stood apart like a statue of obsequiousness, each
hand stuck into the sleeve of the other—responded
as best he might. In the meantime tea and candies
were served by a black hat on bended knee, who also
produced a pair of ornate pipes. The Father of
Swords marvelled that Matthews should have abandoned
the delights of Shustar in order to witness his
poor celebrations of the morrow, in honour of the
coronation. And had he felt no fear of robbers, during
his long night ride from Dizful? But what robbers
were there to fear, protested Matthews, in the
very shadow of Bala Bala? At that the Father of
Swords began to make bitter complaint of the afflictions
Allah had laid upon him, taking his text from
these lines of Sadi: “If thou tellest the sorrows of
thy heart, let it be to him in whose countenance thou
mayst be assured of prompt consolation.” The
world, he declared, was fallen into disorder, like the
hair of an Ethiopian. Within the city wall was a
people well disposed as angels; without, a band of
tigers. After which he asked if the young <i>Firengi</i>
were of the company of those who dug for the poisoned
water of Bakhtiari Land, or whether perchance
he were of the People of the Chain.</p>

<p>These figures of speech would have been incomprehensible
to Matthews, if Abbas had not hinted
something about oil rigs. He accordingly confessed
that he had nothing to do with either of the two enterprises.
The Father of Swords then expatiated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
those who caused the Lurs to seize the hand of amazement
with the teeth of chagrin, by dragging through
their valleys a long chain, as if they meant to take
prisoners. These unwelcome <i>Firengis</i> were also to
be known by certain strange inventions on three
legs, into which they would gaze by the hour. Were
they warriors, threatening devastation? Or were
they magicians, spying into the future and laying
a spell upon the people of Luristan? Their account
of themselves the Father of Swords found far from
satisfactory, claiming as they did that they proposed
to build a road of iron, whereby it would be possible
for a man to go from Dizful to Khorremabad in one
day. For the rest, what business had the people of
Dizful, too many of whom were Arabs, in Khorremabad,
a city of Lurs? Let the men of Dizful remain
in Dizful, and those of Khorremabad continue where
they were born. As for him, his white mules needed
no road of iron to carry him about his affairs.</p>

<p>Matthews, recalling his own thoughts as he leaned
over the parapet of the terrace, spoke consolingly to
the Father of Swords concerning the People of the
Chain. The Father of Swords listened to him, drawing
meditatively at his waterpipe. He thereupon
inquired if Matthews were acquainted with another
friend of the prince among the merchants of Shustar,
himself a <i>Firengi</i> by birth, though recently persuaded
of the truths of Islam; and not like this visitor of good
omen, in the bloom of youth, but bearded and hardened
in battles, bearing the scars of them on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>Matthews began to go over in his mind the short
list of Europeans he had met on the Karun, till suddenly
he bethought him of that extraordinary barge
he had encountered—could it be only a couple of
days ago?</p>

<p>“Magin Sahib?” he asked. “I know him—if he
is the one who travels in the river in a <i>mehala</i> not like
other <i>mehalas</i>, rowed by Lurs.”</p>

<p>“‘That is a musk which discloses itself by its scent,
and not what the perfumers impose upon us,’” quoted
the Father of Swords. “This man,” he continued,
“our friend and the friend of our friend, warned me
that they of the chain are sons of oppression, destined
to bring misfortune to the Lurs. Surely my soul is
tightened, not knowing whom I may believe.”</p>

<p>“Rum bounder!” said Matthews to himself, as his
mind went back to the already mythic barge, and its
fantastic oarsmen from these very mountains, and
its antique-hunting, history-citing master from oversea,
who quoted the Book of Genesis and who carried
mysterious passengers with nose-jewels. But our
not too articulate young man was less prompt about
what he should say aloud. He began to find more in
this interview than he had expected. He was tickled
at his host’s flowery forms of speech, and after all
rather sympathised with the suspicious old ruffian.
Yet it was not for him to fail in loyalty toward the
“People of the Chain.” Several of them he knew, as
it happened, and they had delighted him with their
wild yarns of surveying in Luristan. So he managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
no more than to achieve an appearance of slightly
offended dignity.</p>

<p>Considering which, out of those opaque eyes, the
Father of Swords clapped those famous hands and
commanded a responsive black hat to bring him his
green chest. At that Matthews pricked up interested
ears indeed. The chest, however, when set down in
front of the Father of Swords, proved to be nothing
at all like the one out of which the Brazilian had
taken his gold anklet. It was quite small and painted
green, though quaintly enough provided with triple
locks of beaten iron. The Father of Swords unlocked
them deliberately, withdrew from an inner compartment
a round tin case, and from that a roll of parchment
which he pressed to his lips with infinite
solemnity. He then handed it to Matthews.</p>

<p>He was one, our not too articulate young man, to
take things as they came and not to require, even
east of Suez, the spice of romance with his daily
bread. His last days, moreover, had been too crowded
for him to ruminate over their taste. But it was not
every day that he squatted on the same rug with a
scarlet-bearded old cut-throat of a mountain chief.
So it was that his more or less casual lark visibly
took on, from the perspective of this castle in Luristan,
as he unrolled a gaudy emblazonment of eagles at the
top of the parchment, a new and curious colour. For
below the eagle he came upon what he darkly made
out to be a species of treaty, inscribed neither in the
Arabic nor in the Roman but in the Teutonic character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
between the Father of Swords and a more
notorious War Lord. And below that was signed,
sealed, and imposingly paraphed the signature of one
Julius Magin. Which was indeed a novel aspect for
a Brazilian, however versatile, to reveal.</p>

<p>He permitted himself, did Guy Matthews, a smile.</p>

<p>“You do not kiss it?” observed the Father of
Swords.</p>

<p>“In my country,” Matthews began—</p>

<p>“But it is, may I be your sacrifice,” interrupted
the Father of Swords, “a letter from the Shah of the
Shahs of the <i>Firengis</i>.” It was evident that he was
both impressed and certain of impressing his hearer.
“He has promised eternal peace to me and to my
people.”</p>

<p>The Englishman in Matthews permitted him a
second smile.</p>

<p>“The Father of Swords,” he said, “speaks a word
which I do not understand. I am a <i>Firengi</i>, but I
have never heard of a Shah of the Shahs of the <i>Firengis</i>.
In the house of Islam are there not many who
rule? In Tehran, for instance, there is the young
Ahmed Shah. Then among the Bakhtiaris there is
an Ilkhani, at Mohamera there is the Sheikh of the
Cha’b, and in the valleys of Pusht-i-Kuh none is
above the Father of Swords. I do not forget, either,
the Emirs of Mecca and Afghanistan, or the Sultan in
Stambul. And among them what <i>Firengi</i> shall say
who is the greatest? And so it is in <i>Firengistan</i>. Yet
as for this paper, it is written in the tongue of a king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
smaller than the one whose subject I am, whose
crown has been worn by few fathers. But the name
at the bottom of the paper is not his. It is not even
a name known to the <i>Firengis</i> when they speak
among themselves of the great of their lands. Where
did you see him?”</p>

<p>The Father of Swords stroked his scarlet beard,
looking at his young visitor with more of a gleam in
the dull black of his eyes than Matthews had yet
noticed.</p>

<p>“Truly it is said: ‘Fix not thy heart on what is
transitory, for the Tigris will continue to flow through
Baghdad after the race of Caliphs is extinct!’ You
make it clear to me that you are of the People of the
Chain.”</p>

<p>“If I were of the People of the Chain,” protested
Matthews, “there is no reason why I should hide it.
The People of the Chain do not steal secretly through
the valleys of Pusht-i-Kuh, telling the Lurs lies and
giving them papers in the night. I am not one of
the People of the Chain. But the king of the People
of the Chain is also my king. And he is a great king,
lord of many lands and many seas, who has no need
of secret messengers, hostlers and scullions of whom
no one has heard, to persuade strangers of his greatness.”</p>

<p>“Your words do not persuade me!” cried the
Father of Swords. “A wise man is like a jar in the
house of the apothecary, silent but full of virtues.
If the king who sent me this letter has such hostlers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
and such scullions, how great must be his khans and
viziers! And why do the Turks trust him? Why do
the other <i>Firengis</i> allow his ships in Bushir and Basra?
Or why do not the People of the Chain better
prove the character of their lord? But the hand of
liberality is stronger than the arm of power. This
king, against whom you speak, heard me draw the
sigh of affliction from the bosom of uncertainty. He
deigned to regard me with the eye of patronage,
sending me good words and promises of peace and
friendship. He will not permit the house of Islam to
be troubled. From many we have heard it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Matthews. “Now I understand
why you have not kept your promises to the People
of the Chain!” And he rubbed his thumb against
his forefinger, in the gesture of the East that signifies
the payment of money.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded the Father of Swords, angrily.
“The duty of a king is munificence. Or why
should there be a way to pass through my mountains?
Has it ever been said of the Lur that he
stepped back before a stranger? That is for the
Shah in Tehran, who has become the servant of the
Russian! Let the People of the Chain learn that my
neck does not know how to bow! And what guest
are you to sprinkle my sore with the salt of harsh
words? A boy, who comes here no one knows why,
on hired horses, with only one follower to attend
him!”</p>

<p>Matthews flushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>“Salman Taki Khan,” he retorted, “it is true that
I come to you humbly, and without a beard. And
your beard is already white, and you can call out
thirty thousand men to follow you. Yet a piece of
gold will make you believe a lie. And I swear to you
that whether I give you back this paper to put in
your chest, or whether I spit on it and tear it in
pieces and throw it to the wind of that valley, it is
one.”</p>

<p>To which the Father of Swords made emphatic
enough rejoinder by snatching the parchment away,
rising to his feet, and striding out of the room without
a word.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The festivities in honour of the Shah’s coronation
took place at Bala Bala with due solemnity. Among
the black tents there was much plucking of plaintive
strings, there was more stuffing of mutton and <i>pilau</i>,
and after dark many little rockets, improvised out
of gunpowder and baked clay, traced brief arabesques
of gold against the black of the underlying
gorges. The castle celebrated in the same simple
way. The stuffing, to be sure, was more prolonged
and recondite, while dancers imported from Dizful
swayed and snapped their fingers, singing for the
pleasure of the Father of Swords. The eyes of that
old man of the mountain remained opaque as ever,
save when he rebuked the almoner who sat at meat
with him for indecorously quoting the lines of Sadi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
when he says: “Such was this delicate crescent of
the moon, and fascination of the holy, this form of
an angel, and decoration of a peacock, that let them
once behold her, and continence must cease to exist
in the constitutions of the chaste.”</p>

<p>This rebuke might have been called forth by the
presence of another guest of the board. Be that as
it may, the eyes of the Father of Swords glimmered
perceptibly when they rested on the unannounced
visitor for whom he fished out, with his own henna’ed
fingers, the fattest morsels of mutton and the juiciest
sweets. I hasten to add that the newcomer was not
the one whose earlier arrival and interview with the
Father of Swords has already been recorded. He
was, nevertheless, a personage not unknown to this
record, whether as Senhor Magin of Brazil or as the
emissary of the Shah of the Shahs of <i>Firengistan</i>.
For not only had he felt impelled to bid good-bye a
second time to his friend Adolf Ganz, prince among
the merchants of Shustar. He had even postponed
his voyage down the Karun long enough to make
one more journey overland to Bala Bala. And he
heard there, not without interest, the story of the
short visit and the sudden flight of the young Englishman
he had accidentally met on the river.</p>

<p>As for Matthews, he celebrated the coronation at
Dizful, in bed. And by the time he had slept off his
fag, Bala Bala and the Father of Swords and the
green chest and the ingenious Magin looked to him
more than ever like figures of myth. He was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
little of the timber out of which journalists, romancers,
or diplomats are made to take them very seriously.
The world he lived in, moreover, was too solid
to be shaken by any such flimsy device as the one of
which he had happened to catch a glimpse. What
had been real to him was that he, Guy Matthews,
had been suspected of playing a part in story-book
intrigues, and had been treated rudely by an old
barbarian of whom he expected the proverbial hospitality
of the East. His affair had therefore been
to show Mr. Scarlet Beard that if a Lur could turn
his back, an Englishman could do likewise. He now
saw, to be sure, that he himself had not been altogether
the pattern of courtesy. But the old man of
the mountain had got what was coming to him. And
Matthews regretted very little, after all, missing
what he had gone to see. For Dizful, peering at him
through the arches of the bridge, reminded that there
was still something to see.</p>

<p>It must be said of him, however, that he showed
no impatience to see the neighbouring ruins of Susa.
He was not one, this young man who was out for a
bit of a lark, to sentimentalise about antiquity or
the charm of the unspoiled. Yet even such young
men are capable of finding the rumness of strange
towns a passable enough lark, to say nothing of the
general unexpectedness of life. And Dizful turned
out to be quite as unexpected, in its way, as Bala
Bala. Matthews found that out before he had been
three days in the place, when a sudden roar set all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
the loose little panes tinkling in Shir Ali Khan’s garden
windows.</p>

<p>Abbas explained that this was merely a cannon
shot, announcing the new moon of Ramazan. That
loud call of the faith evidently made Dizful a rummer
place than it normally was. Matthews soon got used
to the daily repetitions of the sound, rumbling off at
sunset and before dawn into the silence of the plains.
But the recurrent explosion became for him the voice
of the particular rumness of that fanatical old border
town—of fierce suns, terrific smells, snapping dogs,
and scowling people. When the stranger without
the gate crossed his bridge of a morning for a stroll
in the town, he felt like a discoverer of some lost
desert city. He threaded alleys of blinding light, he
explored dim thatched bazaars, he studied tiled
doorways in blank mud walls, he investigated quaint
water-mills by the river, and scarce a soul did he see,
unless a stork in its nest on top of a tall <i>badgir</i> or a
naked dervish lying in a scrap of shade asleep under
a lion skin. It was as if Dizful drowsed sullenly in
that July blaze brewing something, like a geyser,
and burst out with it at the end of the unendurable
day.</p>

<p>The brew of the night, however, was a different
mixture, quite the rummest compound of its kind
Matthews had ever tasted. The bang of the sunset
gun instantly brought the deserted city back to life.
Lights began to twinkle—in tea houses, along the
river, among the indigo plantations—streets filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
with ghostly costumes and jostling camels, and everywhere
voices would celebrate the happy return of
dusk so strangely and piercingly that they made
Matthews think of “battles far away.” This was
most so when he listened to them, out of sight of
unfriendly eyes, from his own garden. Above the
extraordinary rumour that drifted to him through
the arches of the bridge he heard the wailing of pipes,
raucous blasts of cow horns, the thumping of drums;
while dogs barked incessantly, and all night long the
caravans of Mesopotamia jingled to and fro. Then
the cannon would thunder out its climax, and the
city would fall anew under the spell of the sun.</p>

<p>The moon of those Arabian nights was nearing its
first quarter and Matthews was waiting for it to become
bright enough for him to fulfill his true duty as
a sight-seer by riding to the mounds of Susa, when
Dizful treated him to fresh discoveries as to what an
unspoiled town may contain. It contained, Abbas
informed Matthews with some mystery after one of
his prolonged visits to the bazaar, another <i>firengi</i>.
This <i>firengi’s</i> servant, moreover, had given Abbas
explicit directions as to the whereabouts of the <i>firengi’s</i>
house, in order that Abbas might give due warning,
as is the custom of the country, of a call from
Matthews. Whereat Matthews made the surprising
announcement that he had not come to Dizful to call
on <i>firengis</i>. The chief charm of Dizful for him, as a
matter of fact, was that there he felt himself free of
the social obligations under which he had lain rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
longer than he liked. But if Abbas was able to resign
himself to this new proof of the eccentricity of his
master, the unknown <i>firengi</i> apparently was not. At
all events, Matthews soon made another discovery
as to the possibilities of Dizful. An evening or two
later, as he loitered on the bridge watching a string
of loaded camels, a respectable-looking old gentleman
in a black <i>aba</i> addressed him in French. French in
Dizful! And it appeared that this remarkable Elamite
was a Jew, who had picked up in Baghdad the
idiom of Paris! He went on to describe himself as
the “agent” of a distinguished foreign resident, who,
the linguistic old gentleman gave Matthews to understand,
languished for a sight of the new-comer, and
was unable to understand why he had not already
been favoured with a call. His pain was the deeper
because the newcomer had recently enjoyed the hospitality
of this distinguished foreign resident on a
little yacht in the river.</p>

<p>“The unmitigated bounder!” exclaimed Matthews,
unable to deliver himself in French of that
sentiment, and turning upon the stupefied old gentleman
a rude Anglo-Saxon back. “He has cheek
enough for anything.”</p>

<p>He had enough, at any rate, to knock the next
afternoon, unannounced, on Matthews’s gate, to follow
Matthews’s servant into the house without waiting
to hear whether Matthews would receive him,
to present himself at the door of the dim underground
<i>serdab</i> where Matthews lounged in his pyjamas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
till it should be cool enough to go out, to make
Matthews the most ceremonious of bows, and to give
that young man a half-amused, half-annoyed, consciousness
of being put at his ease. The advantage
of position, Matthews had good reason to feel, was
with himself. He knew more about the bounder
than the bounder thought, and it was not he who
had knocked at the bounder’s gate. Yet the sound
of that knock, pealing muffled through the hot
silence, had been distinctly welcome. Nor could our
incipient connoisseur of rum towns pretend that the
sight of Magin bowing in the doorway was wholly
unwelcome, so long had he been stewing there in the
sun by himself. What annoyed him, what amused
him, what in spite of himself impressed him, was to
see how the bounder ignored advantages of position.
Matthews had forgotten, too, what an imposing individual
the bounder really was. And measuring his
tall figure, listening to his deep voice, looking at his
light eyes and his two sinister scars and the big
shaved dome of a head which he this time uncovered,
our cool enough young man wondered whether there
might be something more than fantastic about this
navigator of strange waters. It was rather odd, at
all events, how he kept bobbing up, and what a
power he had of quickening—what? A school-boyish
sense of the romantic? Or mere vulgar curiosity?
For he suddenly found himself aware, Guy
Matthews, that what he knew about his visitor was
less than what he desired to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span></p>

<p>The visitor made no haste, however, to volunteer
any information. Nor did he make of Matthews
any but the most perfunctory inquiries.</p>

<p>“And Monsieur—What was his name? Your
Frenchman?” he continued.</p>

<p>“Gaston. He’s not my Frenchman, though,” replied
Matthews. “He went back long ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” uttered Magin. He declined the refreshments
which Abbas at that point produced, even to
the cigarette Matthews offered him. He merely
glanced at the make. Then he examined, with a
flicker of amusement in his eyes, the bare white-washed
room. A runnel of water trickled across it
in a stone channel that widened in the centre into a
shallow pool. “A bit of a lark, eh? I remember that
<i>mot</i> of yours, Mr. Matthews. To sit steaming, or
perhaps I should say dreaming, in a sort of Turkish
bath in the bottom of Elam while over there in
Europe——”</p>

<p>“Is there anything new?” asked Matthews, recognising
his caller’s habit of finishing a sentence
with a gesture. “Archdukes and that sort of thing
don’t seem to matter much in Dizful. I have even
lost track of the date.”</p>

<p>“I would not have thought an Englishman so—<i>dolce
far niente</i>,” said Magin. “It is perhaps because
we archæologists feed on dates! I happen to recollect,
though, that we first met on the eighteenth of July.
And to-day, if you would like to know, is Saturday,
the first of August, 1914.” The flicker of amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
in his eyes became something more inscrutable.
“But there is a telegraph even in Elam,” he
went on. “A little news trickles out of it now and
then. Don’t you ever catch, perhaps, some echo of
the trickle?”</p>

<p>“That’s not my idea of a lark,” laughed Matthews.</p>

<p>Magin regarded him a moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” he conceded, “Europe does take on a new
perspective from the point of view of Susa. I see
you are a philosopher, sitting amidst the ruins of
empires and wisely preferring the trickle of your
fountain to the trickle of the telegraph. If Austria
falls to pieces, if Serbia reaches the Adriatic, what is
that to us? Nothing but a story that in Elam has
been told too often to have any novelty! Eh?”</p>

<p>“Why,” asked Matthews, quickly, “is that on already?”</p>

<p>Magin looked at him again a moment before answering.</p>

<p>“Not yet! But why,” he added, “do you say already?”</p>

<p>His voice had a curious rumble in the dim stone
room. Matthews wondered whether it were because
the acoustic properties of a <i>serdab</i> in Dizful differ
from those of a galley on the Karun, or whether there
really were something new about him.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s bound to come sooner or later, isn’t it?
If it’s true that all the way from Nish to Ragusa
those chaps speak the same language and belong to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
the same race, one can hardly blame them for wanting
to do what the Italians and the Germans have
already done. And, as a philosopher sitting amidst
the ruins of empires, wouldn’t you say yourself that
Austria has bitten off rather more than she can
chew?”</p>

<p>“Very likely I should.” Magin took a cigar out
of his pocket, snipped off the end with a patent cutter,
lighted it, and regarded the smoke with a growing
look of amusement. “But,” he went on, “as a
philosopher sitting amidst the ruins of empires, I
would hardly confine that observation to Austria-Hungary.
For instance, I have heard”—and his
look of amusement verged on a smile—“of an island
in the Atlantic Ocean not much larger than the land
of Elam, an island of rains and fogs whose people,
feeling the need of a little more sunlight perhaps, or
of pin-money and elbow-room, sailed away and conquered
for themselves two entire continents, as well
as a good part of a third. I have also heard that the
inhabitants of this island, not content with killing
and enslaving so many defenceless fellow-creatures,
or with picking up any lesser island, cape, or bay
that happened to suit their fancy, took it upon themselves
to govern several hundred million unwilling
individuals of all colours and religions in other parts of
the world. And, having thus procured both sunlight
and elbow-room, those enterprising islanders assumed
a virtuous air and pushed the high cries—as our
friend Gaston would say—if any of their neighbours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
ever showed the slightest symptom of following their
very successful example. Have you ever heard of
such an island? And would you not say—as a
philosopher sitting amidst the ruins of empires!—that
it had also bitten off rather more than it could
chew?”</p>

<p>Matthews, facing the question and the now open
smile, felt that he wanted to be cool, but that he did
not altogether succeed.</p>

<p>“I dare say that two or three hundred years ago
we did things we wouldn’t do now. Times have
changed in all sorts of ways. But we never set out
like a Cæsar or a Napoleon or a Bismarck to invent
an empire. It all came about quite naturally. Anybody
else could have done the same. But nobody
else thought of it—at the time. We simply got
there first.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” Magin smiled more broadly. “It seems to
me that I have heard of another island, not so far
from here, which is no more than a pin-point, to be
sure, but which happens to be the key of the Persian
Gulf. I have also heard that the Portuguese got
there first, as you put it. But you crushed Portugal,
you crushed Spain, you crushed Holland, you
crushed France—or you meant to. And I must say
it looks to me as if you would not mind crushing
Germany. Why do you go on building ships, building
ships, building ships, always two to Germany’s one?
Simply that you and your friends may go on eating
up Asia and Africa—and perhaps Germany too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Matthews noticed that the elder man ended, at
any rate, not quite so coolly as he began.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! The thing’s so simple it isn’t worth
repeating. We have to have more ships than anybody
else because our empire is bigger than anybody
else’s—and more scattered. As for eating, it strikes
me that Germany has done more of that lately than
any one. However, if you know so much about
islands, you must also know how we happened to go
into India—or Egypt. In the beginning it was pure
accident. And you know very well that if we left
them to-morrow there would be the devil to pay.
Do we get a penny out of them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” laughed Magin. “You administer
them purely on altruistic principles, for their own
good and that of the world at large—like the oil-wells
of the Karun!”</p>

<p>“Well, since you put it that way,” laughed Matthews
in turn, “perhaps we do!”</p>

<p>Magin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary people! Do you really think the
rest of the world so stupid? Or is it that the fog of
your island has got into your brains? You always
talk about truth as if it were a patented British invention,
yet no one is less willing to call a spade a
spade. Look at Cairo, where you pretend to keep
nothing but a consul-general, but where the ruler of
the country can’t turn over in bed without his permission.
A consul-general! Look at your novels!
Look at what you yourself are saying to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>Matthews lighted a pipe over it.</p>

<p>“In a way, of course, you are right,” he said. “But
I am not sure that we are altogether wrong. Spades
exist, but there’s no inherent virtue in talking about
them. In fact it’s often better not to mention them
at all. There’s something very funny about words,
you know. They so often turn out to mean more than
you expected.”</p>

<p>At that Magin regarded his companion with a new
interest.</p>

<p>“I would not have thought you knew that, at your
age! But after all, if you will allow me to say so, it
is a woman’s point of view. A man ought to say
things out—and stick by them. He is less likely to
get into trouble afterward. For example, it would
have been not only more honest but more advantageous
for your country if you had openly annexed
Egypt in the beginning. Now where are you? You
continually have to explain, and to watch very
sharply lest some other consul-general tell the Khedive
to turn over in bed. And since you and the
Russians intend to eat up Persia, why on earth don’t
you do it frankly, instead of trying not to frighten
the Persians, and talking vaguely about spheres of
influence, neutral zones, and what not? I’m afraid
the truth is that you’re getting old and fat. What?”
He glanced over his cigar at Matthews, who was regarding
the trickle of the water beside them. “Those
Russians, they are younger,” he went on. “They
have still to be reckoned with. And they aren’t so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
squeamish, either in novels or in life. Look at what
they have done in their ‘sphere.’ They have roads,
they have Cossacks, they have the Shah under their
thumb. And whenever they choose they shut the
Baghdad trail against your caravans—yours, with
whom they have an understanding! A famous understanding!
You don’t even understand how to
make the most of your own sphere. You have had
the Karun in your hands for three hundred years,
and what have you done with it? Why, in heaven’s
name, didn’t you blast out that rock at Ahwaz long
ago? Why haven’t you made a proper road to Isfahan?
Why don’t you build that railroad to Khorremabad
that you are always talking about, and finish
it before the Germans get to Baghdad? Ah! If
they had been here in your place you would have
seen!”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” retorted Matthews, with less
coolness than he yet had shown, “that you are here
already—from what the Father of the Swords told
me.” And he looked straight at the man who had
told him that an Englishman couldn’t call a spade a
spade. But he saw anew how that man could ignore
an advantage of position.</p>

<p>Magin returned the look—frankly, humorously,
quizzically. Then he said:</p>

<p>“You remind me, by the way, of a question I came
to ask you. Would you object to telling me what
you are up to here?”</p>

<p>“What am I up to?” queried Matthews, in astonishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
The cheek of the bounder was really beyond
everything! “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Magin smiled.</p>

<p>“I am not an Englishman. I mean what I say.”</p>

<p>“No you’re not!” Matthews threw back at him.
“No Englishman would try to pass himself off for a
Brazilian.”</p>

<p>Magin smiled again.</p>

<p>“Nor would a German jump too hastily at conclusions.
If I told you I was from Brazil, I spoke
the truth. I was born there, as were many Englishmen
I know. That makes them very little less English,
though it has perhaps made me more German.
Who knows? As a philosopher sitting with you
amidst the ruins of empires I am at least inclined to
believe that we take our mother country more seriously
than you do yours! But to return to our point:
what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I’m attending to my business. Which seems to
me more than you are doing, Mr. Magin.”</p>

<p>Matthews noticed, from the reverberation of the
room, that his voice must have been unnecessarily
loud. He busied himself with the bowl of his pipe.
As for Magin, he got up and began walking to and
fro, drawing at his cigar. The red of it showed how
much darker the room had been growing. It increased,
too, the curious effect of his eyes. They
looked like two empty holes in a mask.</p>

<p>“Eh, too bad!” sighed the visitor at last. “You
disappoint me. Do you know? You are, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
much younger than I; but you made me hope that
you were perhaps—how shall I put it?—a spirit of
the first class. I hoped that without padding, without
rancour, like true philosophers, we might exchange
our points of view. However—Since it
suits you to stand on your dignity, I must say that I
am very distinctly attending to my business. And
I am obliged to add that it does not help my business,
Mr. Matthews, to have you sitting so mysteriously
in Dizful—and refusing to call on me, but occasionally
calling on nomad chiefs. I confess that you
don’t look to me like a spy. Spies are generally older
men than you, more cooked, as Gaston would say,
more fluent in languages. It does not seem to me,
either, that even an English spy would go about his
affairs quite as you have done. Still, I regret to have
to repeat that I dislike your idea of a lark. And not
only because you upset nomad chiefs. You upset
other people as well. You might even end by upsetting
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” demanded Matthews,
hotly. “The Emperor of Elam?”</p>

<p>“Ha! I see you are acquainted with the excellent
Adolf Ganz!” laughed Magin. “No,” he went on
in another tone. “His viceroy, perhaps. But as I
was saying, it does not suit me to have you stopping
here. I can see, however, that you have reason to
be surprised, possibly annoyed, at my telling you so.
I am willing to be reasonable about it. How much
do you want—for the expenses of your going away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>Matthews could hardly believe his ears. He got
up in turn.</p>

<p>“What in hell do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mr. Matthews,” answered the other
slowly, “that my knowledge of your language does
not permit me to make myself clear to you. Perhaps
you will understand me better if I quote from yourself.
I got here first. Did you ever put your foot
into this country until two weeks ago? Did your
countrymen ever trouble themselves about it, even
after Layard showed them the way? No! They expressly
left it outside of their famous ‘sphere,’ in
that famous neutral zone. And all these centuries
it has been lying here in the sun, asleep, forgotten,
deserted, lost, given over to nomads and to lions—until
I came. I am the first European since Alexander
the Great who has seen what it might be. It
is not so impossible that I might open again those
choked-up canals which once made these burnt plains
a paradise. In those mountains I have found—what
I have found. What right have you to interfere with
me, who are only out for a lark? Or what right have
your countrymen? They have already, as you so
gracefully express it, bitten off so much more than
they can chew! The Gulf, the Karun, the oil-wells—they
are yours. Take them. But Baghdad is
ours: if not to-day, then to-morrow. And if you will
exercise that logical process of which your British
mind appears to be not altogether destitute, you can
hardly help seeing that this part of your famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
neutral zone, if not the whole of it, falls into the
sphere of Baghdad. You know, too, that we do
things more thoroughly than you. Therefore I must
very respectfully but very firmly ask you, at your
very earliest convenience, to leave Dizful. I am
quite willing to believe, however, that your interference
with my arrangements was accidental. And
I dislike to put you to any unnecessary trouble. So
I shall be happy to compensate you, in marks, <i>tomans</i>,
or pounds sterling, for any disappointment
you may feel in bringing this particular lark to an
end. Do you now understand me? How much do
you want?”</p>

<p>He perceived, Guy Matthews, that his lark had
indeed taken an unexpected turn. He was destined,
far sooner than he dreamed, to be asked of life, and
to answer, questions even more direct than this.
But until now life had chosen to confront him with
no problem more pressing than one of cricket or
hunting. He was therefore troubled by an unwonted
confusion of feelings. For he felt that his ordinary
vocabulary—made up of such substantives as lark,
cheek, and bounder, and the comprehensive adjective
rum—fell short of coping with this extraordinary
speech. He even felt that he might possibly
have answered in a different way, but for that unspeakable
offer of money. And the rumble of Magin’s
bass in the dark stone room somehow threw a
light on the melancholy land without, somehow gave
him a dim sense that he did not answer for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
alone—that he answered for the tradition of Layard
and Rawlinson and Morier and Sherley, of Clive and
Kitchener, of Drake and Raleigh and Nelson, of all
the adventurous young men of that beloved foggy
island at which this pseudo-Brazilian jeered.</p>

<p>“When I first met you in the river, Mr. Magin,”
he said quietly, “I confess I did not realise how
much of the spoils of Susa you were carrying away
in your chests. And I didn’t take your gold anklet
as a bribe, though I didn’t take you for too much of
a gentleman in offering it to me. But all I have to
say now is that I shall stay in Dizful as long as I
please—and that you had better clear out of this
house unless you want me to kick you out.”</p>

<p>“Heroics, eh? You obstinate little fool! I could
choke you with one hand!”</p>

<p>“You’d better try!” retorted Matthews.</p>

<p>He started in spite of himself when a muffled boom
suddenly answered him, jarring even the sunken walls
of the room. Then he remembered that voice of the
drowsing city, bursting out with the pent-up brew of
the day.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Magin strangely—“The cannon
speaks at last! You will hear, beside your fountain,
what it has to say. That, at any rate, you will perhaps
understand—you and the people of your island.”
He stopped a moment. “But,” he went on,
“if some fasting dervish knocks you on the head with
his mace, or sticks his knife into your back, don’t say
I didn’t warn you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>And the echo of his receding stamp in the corridor
drowned for a moment the trickle of the invisible
water.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The destiny of some men lies coiled within them,
invisible as the blood of their hearts or the stuff of
their will, working darkly, day by day and year after
year, for their glory or for their destruction. The
destiny of other men is an accident, a god from the
machine or an enemy in ambush. Such was the
destiny of Guy Matthews, as it was of how many
other unsuspecting young men of his time. It would
have been inconceivable to him, as he stood in his
dark stone room listening to Magin’s receding stamp,
that anything could make him do what Magin demanded.
Yet something did—the last drop of the
acrid essence Dizful had been brewing for him.</p>

<p>The letter that accomplished this miracle came to
him by the hand of a Bakhtiari from Meidan-i-Naft.
It said very little. It said so little, and that little so
briefly, that Matthews, still preoccupied with his
own quarrel, at first saw no reason why a stupid war
on the Continent, and the consequent impossibility
of telegraphing home except by way of India, should
affect the oil-works, or why his friends should put
him in the position of showing Magin the white
feather. But as he turned over the Bakhtiari’s scrap
of paper the meaning of it grew, in the light of the
very circumstances that made him hesitate, so portentously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
that he sent Abbas for horses. And before
the Ramazan gun boomed again he was well on
his way back to Meidan-i-Naft.</p>

<p>There was something unreal to him about that
night ride eastward across the dusty moonlit plain.
He never forgot that night. The unexpectedness of
it was only a part of the unreality. What pulled
him up short was a new quality in the general unexpectedness
of life. Life had always been, like the
trip from which he was returning, more or less of a
lark. Whereas it suddenly appeared that life might,
perhaps, be very little of a lark. So far as he had
ever pictured life to himself he had seen it as an extension
of his ordered English countryside, beset by
no hazard more searching than a hawthorne hedge.
But the plain across which he rode gave him a new
picture of it, lighted romantically enough by the
moon, yet offering a rider magnificent chances to
break his neck in some invisible nullah, if not to be
waylaid by marauding Lurs or lions. It even began
to come to this not too articulate young man that
romance and reality might be the same thing, romance
being what happens to the other fellow and
reality being what happens to you. He looked up at
the moon of war that had been heralded to him by
cannon and tried to imagine what, under that same
moon far away in Europe, was happening to the
other fellow. For it was entirely on the cards that
it might also happen to him, Guy Matthews, who
had gone up the Ab-i-Diz for a lark! That experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
had an extraordinary air of having happened to someone
else, as he went back in his mind to his cruise on
the river, his meeting with the barge, his first glimpse
of Dizful, the interlude of Bala Bala, the return to
Dizful, the cannon, Magin. Magin! He was extraordinary
enough, in all conscience, as Matthews tried
to piece together, under his romantic-realistic moon,
the various unrelated fragments his memory produced
of that individual, connoisseur of Greek kylixes
and Lur nose-jewels, quoter of Scripture and
secret agent.</p>

<p>The bounder must have known, as he sat smoking
his cigar and ironising on the ruins of empires, that
the safe and settled little world to which they both
belonged was already in a blaze. Of course he had
known it—and he had said nothing about it! But
not least extraordinary was the way the bounder,
whom after all Matthews had only seen twice, seemed
to colour the whole adventure. In fact, he had been
the first speck in the blue, the forerunner—if Matthews
had only seen it—of the more epic adventure
into which he was so quickly to be caught.</p>

<p>At Shustar he broke his journey. There were still
thirty miles to do, and fresh horses were to be hired—of
some fasting <i>charvadar</i> who would never consent
in Ramazan, Matthews very well knew, to start for
Meidan-i-Naft under the terrific August sun. But
he was not ungrateful for a chance to rest. He discovered
in himself, too, a sudden interest in the
trickle of the telegraph. And he was anxious to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
up what news he could from the few Europeans in
the town. Moreover, he needed to see Ganz about
the replenishing of his money-bag; for not the lightest
item of the traveller’s pack in Persia is his load of
silver <i>krans</i>.</p>

<p>At the telegraph office Matthews ran into Ganz
himself. The Swiss was a short fair faded man, not
too neat about his white clothes, with a pensive
moustache and an ambiguous blue eye that lighted at
sight of the young Englishman. The light, however,
was not one to illuminate Matthews’s darkness in the
matter of news. What news trickled out of the local
wire was very meagre indeed. The Austrians were
shelling Belgrade, the Germans, the Russians, and
the French had gone in. That was all. No, not
quite all; for the bank-rate in England had suddenly
jumped sky-high—higher, at any rate, than it had
ever jumped before. And even Shustar felt the distant
commotion, in that the bazaar had already seen
fit to put up the price of sugar and petroleum. Not
that Shustar showed any outward sign of commotion
as the two threaded their way toward Ganz’s house.
The deserted streets reminded Matthews strangely
of Dizful. What was stranger was to find how they
reminded him of a chapter that is closed. He hardly
noticed the blank walls, the archways of brick and
tile, the tall <i>badgirs</i>, even the filth and smells. But
strangest was it to listen to the hot silence, to look
up at the brilliant stripe of blue between the adobe
walls, while over there—!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>The portentous uncertainty of what might be over
there made his answers to Ganz’s questions about his
journey curt and abstracted. He gave no explanation
of his failure to see the celebration at Bala Bala
and the ruins of Susa, which Ganz supposed to be the
chief objects of his excursion. Yet he found himself
looking with a new eye at the anomalous exile whom
the Father of Swords called the prince among the
merchants of Shustar, noting the faded untidy air as
he had never noted it before, wondering why a man
should bury himself in such a hole as this. Was one
now, he speculated, to look at everybody all over
again? He was not the kind of man, Ganz, to interest
the Guy Matthews who had gone to Dizful.
But it was the Guy Matthews who came back from
Dizful who didn’t like Ganz’s name or Ganz’s good
enough accent. Nevertheless he yielded to Ganz’s
insistence, when they reached the office and the
money-bag had been restored to its normal portliness,
that the traveller should step into the house to
rest and cool off.</p>

<p>“Do come!” urged the Swiss. “I so seldom
see a civilised being. And I have a new piano!”
he threw in as an added inducement. “Do you
play?”</p>

<p>He had no parlour tricks, he told Ganz, and he told
himself that he wanted to get on. But Ganz had
been very decent to him, after all. And he began to
perceive that he himself was extremely tired. So he
followed Ganz through the cloister of the pool to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
court where the great basin glittered in the sun, below
the pillared portico.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” exclaimed Ganz suddenly. “What
a tone, eh? And what a touch!”</p>

<p>Matthews heard from Ganz’s private quarters a
welling of music so different from the pipes and cow-horns
of Dizful that it gave him a sudden stab of
homesickness.</p>

<p>“I say,” he said, brightening, “could it be any of
the fellows from Meidan-i-Naft?”</p>

<p>The ambiguous blue eye brightened too.</p>

<p>“Perhaps! It is the river music from <i>Rheingold</i>.
But listen,” Ganz added with a smile. “There are
sharks among the Rhine maidens!”</p>

<p>They went on, up the steps of the portico, to the
door which Ganz opened softly, stepping aside for his
visitor to pass in. The room was so dark, after the
blinding light of the court, that Matthews saw
nothing at first. He stepped forward eagerly, feeling
his way among Ganz’s tables and chairs toward the
end of the room from which the music came. They
gave him, the cluttering tables and chairs, after the
empty rooms he had been living in, a sharper renewal
of his stab. And even a piano—! It made him
think of Kipling and the <i>Song of the Banjo</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am memory and torment—I am Town!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am all that ever went with evening dress!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But what mute inglorious Paderewski of the restricted
circle he had moved in for the past months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
was capable of such parlour tricks as this? Then,
suddenly, he saw. He saw, swaying back and forth
against the dark background of the piano, a domed
shaven head that made him stop short—that head
full of so many astounding things! He saw, travelling
swiftly up and down the keys, rising above them to
an extravagant height and pouncing down upon
them again, those predatory hands that had pounced
on the spoils of Susa! They began, in a moment, to
flutter lightly over the upper end of the keyboard.
It was extraordinary what a ripple poured as if out
of those hands. Magin himself bent over to listen to
the ripple, partly showing his face as he turned his
ear to the keys. He showed, too, in the lessening
gloom, a smile Matthews had never seen before,
more extraordinary than anything. Yet even as
Matthews watched it, in his stupefaction, the smile
changed, broadened, hardened. And Magin, sitting
up straight again with his back to the room, began
to execute a series of crashing chords.</p>

<p>After several minutes he stopped and swung
around on the piano-stool. Ganz clapped his hands,
shouting “<i>Bis! Bis!</i>” At that Magin rose, bowed
elaborately, and kissed his hands right and left. He
ended by pulling up a table-cover near him, gazing
intently under the table.</p>

<p>“Have you lost something?” inquired Ganz.</p>

<p>“I seem,” answered Magin, “to have lost half my
audience. What has become of our elusive English
friend? Am I so unfortunate as to have been unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
to satisfy his refined ear? Or can it be that his emotions
were too much for him?”</p>

<p>“He was in a hurry,” explained Ganz. “He is just
back from Dizful, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” uttered Magin. “He is a very curious
young man. He is always in a hurry. He was in a
hurry the first time I had the pleasure of meeting
him. He was in such a hurry at Bala Bala that he
didn’t wait to see the celebration which you told me
he went to see. He also left Dizful in a surprising
hurry, from what I hear. I happen to know that the
telegraph had nothing to do with it. I can only conclude
that some one frightened him away. Where
do you suppose he hurries to? And do you think he
will arrive in time?”</p>

<p>Ganz opened his mouth; but if he intended to say
something, he decided instead to draw his hand
across his spare jaw. However, he did speak after
all.</p>

<p>“I notice that you at least do not hurry, Majesty!
Do you fiddle while Rome burns?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” laughed Magin. “It is not Rome that
burns! And I notice, Mr. Ganz, that you seem to
be of a forgetful as well as of an inquiring disposition.
I would have been in Mohamera long ago if it had
not been for your Son of Papa, with his interest in
unspoiled towns. I will thank you to issue no more
letters to the Father of Swords without remembering
me. Do you wish to enrich the already overstocked
British Museum at my expense? But I do not mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
revealing to you that I am now really on my way to
Mohamera.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” let out Ganz slowly. “My dear fellow,
haven’t you heard that there is a war in Europe?”</p>

<p>“I must confess, my good Ganz, that I have. But
what has Europe to do with Mohamera?”</p>

<p>“God knows,” said Ganz. “I should think however,
since you are so far from the Gulf, that you
would prefer the route of Baghdad—now that
French and Russian cruisers are seeking whom they
may devour.”</p>

<p>“You forget, Mr. Ganz, that I am so fortunate as
to possess a number of valuable objects of virtue. I
would think twice before attempting to carry those
objects of virtue through the country of our excellent
friends the Beni Lam Arabs!”</p>

<p>Ganz laughed.</p>

<p>“Your objects of virtue could very well be left with
me. What if the English should go into the war?”</p>

<p>“The English? Go into the war? Never fear!
This is not their affair. And if it were, what could
they do? Sail their famous ships up the Rhine and
the Elbe? Besides, that treacherous memory of
yours seems to fail you again. This is Persia, not
England.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” answered Ganz. “But the English
are very funny people. There is a rumour, you
know, of pourparlers. What if you were to sail down
to the Gulf and some little midshipman were to fire
a shot across your bow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, bah! I am a neutral! And Britannia is a fat
old woman! Also a rich one, who doesn’t put her
hand into her pocket to please her neighbours. Besides,
I have a little affair with the Sheikh of Mohamera—objects
of virtue, indigo, who knows what?
As you know, I am a versatile man.” And swinging
around on his stool, Magin began to play again.</p>

<p>“But even fat old women sometimes know how to
bite,” objected Ganz.</p>

<p>“Not when their teeth have dropped out,” Magin
threw over his shoulder—“or when strong young
men plug their jaws!”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Two days later, or not quite three days later, the
galley and the motor-boat whose accidental encounter
brought about the events of this narrative met
again. This second meeting took place in the Karun,
as before, but at a point some fifty or sixty miles
below Bund-i-Kir. And now the moon, not the sun,
cast its paler glitter between the high dark banks of
the stream.</p>

<p>It was a keen-eared young Lur who first heard
afar the pant of the mysterious jinni. Before
he or his companions descried the motor-boat,
however, Gaston, rounding a sharp curve above
the island of Umm-un-Nakhl, caught sight of the
sweeps of the barge flashing in the moonlight. The
unexpected view of that flash was not disagreeable
to Gaston. For, as Gaston put it to himself, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
sad—despite the efforts of his friend, the telegraph
operator at Ahwaz, to cheer him up. It is true that
the operator, who was Irish and a man of heart, had
accorded him but a limited amount of cheer, together
with hard words not a few. Recalling them,
Gaston picked up a knife that lay on the seat beside
him—an odd curved knife of the country, in a leather
sheath. There is no reason why I should conceal the
fact that this knife was a gift from Gaston’s Bakhtiari
henchman, who had presented it to Gaston, with
immense solemnity, on hearing that there was a war
in <i>Firengistan</i> and that the young men of the oil
works were going to it. What had become of that type
of a Bakhtiari, Gaston wondered? Then, spying the
flash of those remembered oars, he bethought him
of the seigneur of a Brazilian whose hospitable yacht,
he had reason to know, was not destitute of cheer.</p>

<p>When he was near enough the barge to make out
the shadow of the high beak on the moonlit water he
cut off the motor. The sweeps forthwith ceased to
flash. Gaston then called out the customary salutation.
It was answered, as before, by the deep voice
of the Brazilian. He stood at the rail of the barge as
the motor-boat glided alongside.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mon vieux</i>, you are alone this time?” said
Magin genially. “Where are the others?”</p>

<p>“I do not figure to myself,” answered Gaston,
“that you derange yourself to inquire for my sacred
devil of a Bakhtiari, who has taken the key of the
fields. As for Monsieur Guy, the Englishman you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
saw the other time, whose name does not pronounce
itself, he has gone to the war. I just took him and
three others to Ahwaz, where they meet more of
their friends and all go together on the steamer to
Mohamera.”</p>

<p>“Really! And did you hear any news at
Ahwaz?”</p>

<p>“The latest is that England has declared war.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i>” exclaimed Magin. His voice was extraordinarily
loud and deep in the stillness of the river. It
impressed Gaston, who sat looking up at the dark
figure in front of the ghostly Lurs. What types, with
their black hats of a theatre! He hoped the absence
of M’sieu Guy and the Brazilian’s evident surprise
would not cloud the latter’s hospitality. He was accordingly
gratified to hear the Brazilian say, after a
moment: “And they tell us that madness is not
catching! But we, at least, have not lost our heads.
Eh? To prove it, Monsieur Gaston, will you not
come aboard a moment, if you are not in too much of
a hurry, and drink a little glass with me?”</p>

<p>Gaston needed no urging. In a trice he had lashed
his boat to the barge and was on the deck. The agreeable
Brazilian was not too much of a seigneur to
shake his hand in welcome, or to lead him into the
cabin where a young Lur was in the act of lighting
candles.</p>

<p>“It is so hot, and so many strange beasts fly about
this river,” Magin explained, “that I usually prefer
to travel without a light. But we must see the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
to our mouths! What will you have? Beer? Bordeaux?
Champagne?”</p>

<p>Gaston considered this serious question with attention.</p>

<p>“Since Monsieur has the goodness to inquire, if
Monsieur has any of that <i>fine champagne</i> I tasted
before——”</p>

<p>“Ah yes! Certainly.” And he gave a rapid order
to the Lur. Then he stood silent, his eyes fixed on
the reed portière. Gaston was more impressed than
ever as he stood too, <i>béret</i> in hand, looking around
the little saloon, so oddly, yet so comfortably fitted
out with rugs and skins. Presently the Lur reappeared
through the reed portière, which aroused the
Brazilian from his abstraction. He filled the two
glasses himself, waving his attendant out of the cabin,
and handed one to Gaston. The other he raised
in the air, bowing to his guest. “To the victor!” he
said. “And sit down, won’t you? There is more
than one glass in that bottle.”</p>

<p>Gaston was enchanted to sit down and to sip another
cognac.</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur,” he exclaimed, looking about
again, “you travel like an emperor!”</p>

<p>“Ho!” laughed Magin, with a quick glance at
Gaston. “I am well enough here. But there is one
difficulty.” He looked at his glass, holding it up to
the light. “I travel too slowly.”</p>

<p>Gaston smiled.</p>

<p>“In Persia, who cares?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it happens that at this moment I do. I
have affairs at Mohamera. And in this tub it will
take me three days more at the best—without considering
that I shall have to wait till daylight to get
through the rocks at Ahwaz.” He lowered his glass
and looked back at Gaston. “Tell me: Why shouldn’t
you take me down, ahead of my tub? Eh? Or to
Sablah, if Mohamera is too far? It would not delay
you so much, after all. You can tell them any story
you like at Sheleilieh. Otherwise I am sure we can
make a satisfactory arrangement.” He put his hand
suggestively into his pocket.</p>

<p>Gaston considered it between sips. It really was
not much to do for this uncle of America who had
been so amiable. And others had suddenly become
so much less amiable than their wont. Moreover
that Bakhtiari—he might repent when he heard the
motor again. At any rate one could say that one had
waited for him. And the Brazilian would no doubt
show a gratitude so handsome that one could afford
to be a little independent. If those on the steamer
asked any questions when the motor-boat passed,
surely the Brazilian, who was more of a seigneur
than any employé of an oil company, would know
how to answer.</p>

<p>“<i>Allons!</i> Why not?” he said aloud.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the Brazilian, withdrawing his
hand from his pocket. “Take that as part of my
ticket. And excuse me a moment while I make
arrangements.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span></p>

<p>He disappeared through the reed portière, leaving
Gaston to admire five shining napoleons. It gave
him an odd sensation to see, after so long, those coins
of his country. When Magin finally came back, it
was through the inner door.</p>

<p>“Tell me: how much can you carry?” he asked.
“I have four boxes I would like to take with me, besides
a few small things. These fools might wreck
themselves at Ahwaz and lose everything in the
river. It would annoy me very much—after all the
trouble I have had to collect my objects of virtue!
Besides, the tub will get through more easily without
them. Come in and see.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Gaston, scratching his
head, when he saw. “My boat won’t get through
more easily with them, especially at night.” He
looked curiously around the cozy stateroom.</p>

<p>“But it will take them, eh? If necessary, we can
land them at Ahwaz and have them carried around
the rapids.”</p>

<p>The thing took some manœuvring; but the Lurs,
with the help of much fluent profanity from their
master, finally accomplished it without sinking the
motor-boat. Gaston, sitting at the wheel to guard
his precious engine against some clumsiness of the
black-hatted mountaineers, looked on with humorous
astonishment at this turn of affairs. He was
destined, it appeared, to be disappointed in his hope
of cheer. That cognac was really very good—if only
one had had more of it. Still, one at least had company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
now; and he was not the man to be insensible
to the fine champagne of the unexpected. Nor was
he unconscious that of many baroque scenes at which
he had assisted, this was not the least baroque.</p>

<p>When the fourth chest had gingerly been lowered
into place, Magin vanished again. Presently he reappeared,
followed by his majordomo, to whom he
gave instructions in a low voice. Then he stepped
into the stern of the boat. The majordomo, taking
two portmanteaux and a rug from the Lurs behind
him, handed them down to Gaston. Having disposed
of them, Gaston stood up, his eyes on the Lurs
who crowded the rail.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” said Magin gaily, “for whom
are you waiting? We shall yet have opportunities
to admire the romantic scenery of the Karun!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur takes no—other object of virtue
with him?”</p>

<p>“Have you so much room?” laughed Magin. “It
is a good thing there is no wind to-night. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Gaston cast off, backed a few feet, reversed, and
described a wide arc around the stern of the barge.
It made a singular picture in the moonlight, with its
black-curved beak and its spectral crew. They
shifted to the other rail as the motor-boat came
about, watching silently.</p>

<p>“To your oars!” shouted Magin at them. “Row,
sons of burnt fathers! Will you have me wait a
month for you at Mohamera?”</p>

<p>They scattered to their places, and Gaston caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
the renewed flash of the sweeps as he turned to steer
for the bend. It was a good thing, he told himself,
that there was no wind to-night. The gunwale was
nearer the water than he or the boat cared for. She
made nothing like her usual speed. However, he said
nothing. Neither did Magin—until the dark shadow
of Umm-un-Nakhl divided the glitter in front of
them.</p>

<p>“Take the narrower channel,” he ordered then.
And when they were in it he added: “Stop, will
you, and steer in there, under the shadow of the
shore? I think we would better fortify ourselves for
the work of the night. I at least did not forget the
cognac, among my other objects of virtue.”</p>

<p>They fortified themselves accordingly, the Brazilian
producing cigars as well. He certainly was an
original, thought Gaston, now hopeful of experiencing
actual cheer. That originality proved itself anew
when, after a much longer period of refreshment than
would suit most gentlemen in a hurry, the familiar
flash became visible in the river behind them.</p>

<p>“Now be quiet,” commanded the extraordinary
uncle of America. “What ever happens we mustn’t
let them hear us. If they take this channel, we will
slip down, and run part way up the other. We shall
give them a little surprise.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the flash, which suddenly
went out behind the island. A recurrent splash succeeded
it, and a wild melancholy singing. The singing
and the recurrent splash grew louder, filled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
silence of the river, grew softer; and presently the
receding oars flashed again, below the island. But
not until the last glint was lost in the shimmer of the
water, the last sound had died out of the summer
night, did the Brazilian begin to unfold his surprise.</p>

<p>“<i>Que diable allait-on faire dans cette galère!</i>” he exclaimed.
“It’s the first time I ever knew them to do
the right thing! Let us drink one more little glass to
the good fortune of their voyage. And here, by the
way, is another part of my ticket.” He handed
Gaston five more napoleons. “But now, my friend,
we have some work. I see we shall never get anywhere
with all this load. Let us therefore consign
our objects of virtue to the safe keeping of the river.
He will guard them better than anybody. Is it deep
enough here?”</p>

<p>It was deep enough. But what an affair, getting
those heavy chests overboard! The last one nearly
pulled Magin in with it. One of the clamps caught
in his clothes, threw him against the side of the boat,
and jerked something after it into the water. He
sat down, swearing softly to himself, to catch his
breath and investigate the damage.</p>

<p>“It was only my revolver,” he announced. “And
we have no need of that, since we are not going to
the war! Now, my good Gaston, I have changed my
mind. We shall not go down the river, after all. We
will go up.”</p>

<p>Gaston, this time, stared at him.</p>

<p>“Up? But, Monsieur, the barge——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span></p>

<p>“What is my barge to you, dear Gaston? Besides,
it is no longer mine. It now belongs to the Sheikh
of Mohamera—with whatever objects of virtue it
still contains. He has long teased me for it. And
none of them can read the note they are carrying to
him! Didn’t I tell you I was going to give them a
little surprise? Well, there it is. I am not a man,
you see, to be tied to objects of virtue. Which reminds
me: where are my portmanteaux?”</p>

<p>“Here, on the tank.”</p>

<p>“Fi! And you a chauffeur! Give them to me. I
will arrange myself a little. As for you, turn around
and see how quickly you can carry me to the charming
resort of Bund-i-Kir—where Antigonus fought
Eumenes and the Silver Shields for the spoils of Susa,
and won them. Did you ever hear, Gaston, of that
interesting incident?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is too strong for me,” replied Gaston,
cryptically. He took off his cap, wiped his face, and
sat down at the wheel.</p>

<p>“If a man is not strong, what is he?” rejoined
Magin. “But you will not find this cigar too strong,”
he added amicably.</p>

<p>Gaston did not. What he found strong was the
originality of his passenger—and the way that cognac
failed, in spite of its friendly warmth, to cheer
him. For he kept thinking of that absurd Bakhtiari,
and of the telegraph operator, and of M’sieu Guy,
and the others, as he sped northward on the silent
moonlit river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>“This is very well, eh, Gaston?” uttered the
Brazilian at last. “We march better without our
objects of virtue.” Gaston felt that he smiled as he
lay smoking on his rug in the bottom of the boat.
“But tell me,” he went on presently. “How is it,
if I may ask, that you didn’t happen to go in the
steamer too, with your Monsieur Guy? You do not
look to me either old or incapable.”</p>

<p>There it was, the same question, which really
seemed to need no answer at first, but which somehow
became harder to answer every time! Why
was it? And how could it spoil so good a cognac?</p>

<p>“How is it?” repeated Gaston. “It is, Monsieur,
that France is a great lady who does not derange
herself for a simple vagabond like Gaston, or about
whose liaisons or quarrels it is not for Gaston to concern
himself. This great lady has naturally not asked
my opinion about this quarrel. But if she had, I
would have told her that it is very stupid for everybody
in Europe to begin shooting at everybody else.
Why? Simply because it pleases <i>ces messieurs</i> the
Austrians to treat <i>ces messieurs</i> the Serbs <i>de haut en
bas</i>! What have I to do with that? Besides, this
great lady is very far away, and by the time I arrive
she will have arranged her affair. In the meantime
there are many others, younger and more capable
than I, whose express business it is to arrange such
affairs. Will one <i>piou-piou</i> more or less change the
result of the battle? Of course not! And if I should
lose my hand or my head, who would buy me another?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
Not France! I have seen a little what France
does in such cases. My own father left his leg at
Gravelotte, together with his job and my mother’s
peace. I have seen what happened to her, and how
it is that I am a vagabond—about whom France has
never troubled herself.” He shouted it over his
shoulder, above the noise of the motor, with an increasing
loudness. “Also,” he went on, “I have
duties not so far away as France. Up there, at
Sheleilieh, there will perhaps be next month a little
Gaston. If I go away, who will feed him? I have
not the courage of Monsieur, who separates himself
so easily from objects of virtue. <i>Voilà!</i>”</p>

<p>Magin said nothing for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“Courage, yes! One needs a little courage in this
curious world.” There was a pause, as the boat cut
around a dark curve. “But do not think, my poor
Gaston, that it is I who blame you. On the contrary,
I find you very reasonable—more reasonable
than many ministers of state. If others in Europe
had been able to express themselves like you, Gaston,
Monsieur Guy and his friends would not have
run away so suddenly. It takes courage, too, not to
run after them.” He made a sound, as if changing
his position, and presently he began to sing softly to
himself.</p>

<p>“Monsieur would make a fortune in the <i>café-chantant</i>,”
commented Gaston. He began to feel, at
last, after the favourable reception of his speech, a
little cheered. He felt cooler, too, in this quiet rushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
moonlight of the river. “What is it that Monsieur
sings? It seems to me that I have heard that
air.”</p>

<p>“Very likely you have, Gaston. It is a little song
of sentiment, sung by all the sentimental young
ladies of the world. He who wrote it, however, was
far from sentimental. He was a fellow countryman
of mine—and of the late Abraham!—who loved your
country so much that he lived in it and died in it.”
And Magin sang again, more loudly, the first words
of the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ich weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dass ich so traurig bin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ein Märchen aus alten Zeiten,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Das kommt mir nicht aus dem Sinn.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gaston listened with admiration, astonishment,
and perplexity. It suddenly came back to him how
this original Brazilian had sworn when the chest
caught his clothes.</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur, I thought—Are you, then, a
German?”</p>

<p>Magin, after a second, laughed.</p>

<p>“But, Gaston, am I then an enemy?”</p>

<p>Gaston examined him in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered slowly, “if your country and
mine are at war——”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with us, as you just now so
truly said? You have found that your country’s
quarrel was not cause enough for you to leave Persia,
and so have I. <i>Voilà tout!</i>” He examined Gaston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
in turn. “But I thought you knew all the time.
Such is fame! I flattered myself that your Monsieur
Guy would leave no one untold. Whereas he has left
us the pleasure of a situation more piquant, after all,
than I supposed. We enjoy the magnificent moonlight
of the South, we admire a historic river under
its most successful aspect, and we do not exalt ourselves
because our countrymen, many hundreds of
miles away, have lost their heads.” He smiled over
the piquancy of the situation. “Strength is good,”
he went on in his impressive bass, “and courage is
better. But reason, as you so justly say, is best of
all. For which reason,” he added, “allow me to recommend
to you, my dear Gaston, that you look a
little where you are steering.”</p>

<p>Gaston looked. But he discovered that his moment
of cheer had been all too brief. A piquant situation,
indeed! The piquancy of that situation
somehow complicated everything more darkly than
before. If there were reasons why he should not go
away with the others, as they had all taken it for
granted that he would do, was that a reason why he,
Gaston, whose father had lost a leg at Gravelotte,
should do this masquerading German a service? All
the German’s amiability and originality did not
change that. Perhaps, indeed, that explained the
originality and amiability.</p>

<p>The German, at any rate, did not seem to trouble
himself about it. When Gaston next looked over
his shoulder, Magin was lying flat on his back in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
bottom of the boat, with his hands under his head
and his eyes closed. And so he continued to lie,
silent and apparently asleep, while his troubled companion,
<i>beret</i> on ear and hand on wheel, steered
through the waning moonlight of the Karun.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The moon was but a ghost of itself, and a faint
rose was beginning to tinge the pallor of the sky behind
the Bakhtiari mountains, when the motor began
to miss fire. Gaston, stifling an exclamation, cut it
off, unscrewed the cap of the tank, and measured the
gasoline. Then he stepped softly forward to the
place in the bow where he kept his reserve tins.
Magin, roused by the stopping of the boat, sat up,
stretching.</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i>” he exclaimed. “Here we are!” He
looked about at the high clay banks enclosing the
tawny basin of the four rivers. In front of him the
konar trees of Bund-i-Kir showed their dark green.
At the right, on top of the bluff of the eastern shore,
a solitary peasant stood white against the sky. Near
him a couple of oxen on an inclined plane worked the
rude mechanism that drew up water to the fields.
The creak of the pulleys and the splash of the dripping
goatskins only made more intense the early
morning silence. “Do you remember, Gaston?”
asked Magin. “It was here we first had the good
fortune to meet—not quite three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” answered Gaston, keeping his eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
on the mouth of the tank he was filling, “that I was
the one who wished you peace, Monsieur. And that
no one asked who you were, or where you were
going.”</p>

<p>Magin yawned.</p>

<p>“Well, you seem to have satisfied yourself now on
those important points. I might add, however, for
your further information, that I think I shall not go
to Bund-i-Kir, which looks too peaceful to disturb
at this matinal hour, but there—to the western
shore of the Ab-i-Shuteit. And that reminds me. I
still have to pay you the rest of my ticket.”</p>

<p>He reached forward and laid a little pile of gold on
Gaston’s seat. Gaston, watching out of the corner
of his eye as he poured gasoline, saw that there were
more than five napoleons in that pile. There were
at least ten.</p>

<p>“What would you say, Monsieur,” he asked slowly,
emptying his tin, “if I were to take you instead
to Sheleilieh—where there are still a few of the
English?”</p>

<p>“I would say, my good Gaston, that you had more
courage than I thought. By the way,” he went on
casually, “what is this?”</p>

<p>He reached forward again toward Gaston’s seat,
where lay the Bakhtiari’s present. Gaston dropped
his tin and made a snatch at it. But Magin was too
quick for him. He retreated to his place at the
stern of the boat, where he drew the knife out of
its sheath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>

<p>“Sharp, too!” he commented, with a smile at
Gaston. “And my revolver is gone!”</p>

<p>Gaston, very pale, stepped to his seat.</p>

<p>“That, Monsieur, was given me by my Bakhtiari
brother-in-law—to take to the war. When he found
I had not the courage to go, he ran away from
me.”</p>

<p>“But you thought there might be more than one
way to make war, eh? Well, I at least am not an
Apache. Perhaps the sharks will know what to do
with it.” The blade glittered in the brightening air
and splashed out of sight. And Magin, folding his
arms, smiled again at Gaston. “Another object of
virtue for the safe custody of the Karun!”</p>

<p>“But not all!” cried Gaston thickly, seizing the
little pile of gold beside him and flinging it after the
knife.</p>

<p>Magin’s smile broadened.</p>

<p>“Have you not forgotten something, Gaston?”</p>

<p>“But certainly not, Monsieur,” he replied, putting
his hand into his pocket. The next moment a second
shower of gold caught the light. And where the
little circles of ripples widened in the river, a sharp
fin suddenly cut the muddy water.</p>

<p>“Oho! Mr. Shark loses no time!” cried Magin.
He stopped smiling, and turned back to Gaston.
“But we do. Allow me to say, my friend, that you
prove yourself really too romantic. This is no doubt
an excellent comedy which we are playing for the
benefit of that gentleman on the bluff. But even he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
begins to get tired of it. See? He starts to say his
morning prayer. So be so good as to show a little
of the reason which you know how to show, and
start for shore. But first you might do well to screw
on the cap of your tank—if you do not mind a little
friendly advice.”</p>

<p>Gaston looked around absent-mindedly, and took
up the nickel cap. But he suddenly turned back to
Magin.</p>

<p>“You speak too much about friends, Monsieur. I
am not your friend. I am your enemy. And I shall
not take you there, to the Ab-i-Shuteit. I shall take
you into the Ab-i-Gerger—to Sheleilieh and the
English.”</p>

<p>Magin considered him, with a flicker in his lighted
eyes.</p>

<p>“You might perhaps have done it if you had not
forgotten about your gasoline. And you may yet.
We shall see. But it seems to me, my—enemy!—that
you make a miscalculation. Let us suppose that
you take me to Sheleilieh. It is highly improbable,
because you no longer have your knife to assist you.
I, it is true, no longer have my revolver to assist me;
but I have two arms, longer and I fancy stronger
than yours. However, let us make the supposition.
And let us make the equally improbable supposition
that I fall into the hands of the English. What can
they do to me? The worst they can do is to give me
free lodging and nourishment till the end of the war!
Whereas you, Gaston—you do not seem to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
reflected that life will not be so simple for you, after
this. There is a very unpleasant little word by which
they name citizens who do not respond to their
country’s call to arms. In other words, Mr. Deserter,
you have taken the road which, in war time, ends
between a firing-squad and a stone wall.”</p>

<p>Gaston, evidently, had not reflected on that. He
stared at his nickel cap, turning it around in his fingers.</p>

<p>“You see?” continued Magin. “Well then, what
about that little Gaston? I do not know what has
suddenly made you so much less reasonable than you
were last night; but I, at least, have not changed.
And I see no reason why that little Gaston should be
left between two horns of a dilemma. In fact I see
excellent reasons not only why you should take
me that short distance to the shore, but why you
should accompany me to Dizful. There I am at home.
I am, more than any one else, emperor. And I need
a man like you. I am going to have a car, I am going
to have a boat, I am going to have a place in the sun.
There will be many changes in that country after
the war. You will see. It is not so far, either,
from here. It is evident that your heart, like mine,
is in this part of the world. So come with me. Eh,
Gaston?”</p>

<p>“Heart!” repeated Gaston, with a bitter smile.
“It is you who speak of the heart, and of—But you
do not speak of the little surprise with which you
might some day regale me, Mr. Enemy! Nor do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
you say what you fear—that I might take it into my
head to go fishing at Umm-un-Nakhl!”</p>

<p>“Ah bah!” exclaimed Magin impatiently. “However,
you are right. I am not like you. I do not
betray my country for a little savage with a jewel in
her nose! It is because of that small difference between
us, Gaston, between your people and my people,
that you will see such changes here after the war.
But you will not see them unless you accept my
offer. After all, what else can you do?” He left
Gaston to take it in as he twirled his metal cap.
“There is the sun already,” Magin added presently.
“We shall have a hot journey.”</p>

<p>Gaston looked over his shoulder at the quivering
rim of gold that surged up behind the Bakhtiari
mountains. How sharp and purple they were,
against what a deepening blue! On the bluff the
white-clad peasant stood with his back to the light,
his hands folded in front of him, his head bowed.</p>

<p>“You look tired, Gaston,” said Magin pleasantly.
“Will you have this cigar?”</p>

<p>“No thank you,” replied Gaston. He felt in his
own pockets, however, first for a cigarette and then
for a match. He was indeed tired, so tired that he
no longer remembered which pocket to fumble in or
what he held in his hand as he fumbled. Ah, that
sacred tank! Then he suddenly smiled again, looking
at Magin. “There is something else I can do!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Magin as he lay at ease in the
stern, enjoying the first perfume of his cigar. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
can’t go back to France, now, and I should hardly
advise you to go back to Sheleilieh. At least until
after the war. Then you will find no more English
there to ask you troublesome questions!”</p>

<p>Gaston lighted his cigarette. And, keeping his
eyes on Magin, he slowly moved his hand, in which
were both the nickel cap and the still burning match,
toward the mouth of the tank.</p>

<p>“This!” he answered.</p>

<p>Magin watched him. He did not catch the connection
at first. He saw it quickly enough, however.
In his pale translucent eyes there was something
very like a flare.</p>

<p>“Look out—or we shall go together after all!”</p>

<p>“We shall go together, after all,” repeated Gaston.
“And here is your place in the sun!”</p>

<p>Magin still watched, as the little flame flickered
through the windless air. But he did not move.</p>

<p>“It will go out! And you have not the courage,
Apache!”</p>

<p>“You will see, Prussian!” The match stopped,
at last, above the open hole. But the hand that held
it trembled a little, and so did the strange low voice
that said: “This at least I can do—for that great
lady, far away....”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The peasant on the bluff, prostrated toward Mecca
with his forehead in the dust, was startled out of his
prayer by a roar in the basin below him. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
where the trimwhite jinn-boat of the <i>Firengi</i> had
been was now a blazing mass of wreckage, out of
which burst fierce cracklings, hissings, cries, sounds
not to be named.</p>

<p>As he stared at it the wreckage fell apart, began to
disappear in a cloud of smoke and steam that
lengthened toward the southern gateway of the basin.
And in the turbid water, cut by swift sharks’ fins,
he saw a sudden streak of scarlet, vivider than any
fire or sunrise. The sounds ceased, the dyed waters
paled, the smoke melted after the steam, the current
caught the last charred fragments of wreckage and
drew them out of sight.</p>

<p>The peasant watched it all in silence, as if waiting
for some new sorcery of the <i>Firengi</i>, from his high
bank of the Karun—that snow-born river bound for
distant palms, that had seen so many generations of
the faces of men, so many of the barks to which men
trust their hearts, their hopes, their treasures, as it
wound, century after century, from the mountains
to the sea.</p>

<p>Then, at last, the peasant folded his hands anew
and bowed his head toward Mecca.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
